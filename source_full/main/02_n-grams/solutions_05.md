# Succinctness and choosing between grammars (Solutions)

::: exercise
For $n \geq 2$, no grammar ever needs to contain every member of $\Sigma_E^n$.
Explain why.

::: solution
There are two answers here.
First, if $\Sigma_E^n$ is taken to contain useless $n$-grams like ${{{R}}}{{{L}}}$ or ${{{R}}}ab$, then these do not need to be included in the grammar because no string will ever have ${{{R}}}$ preceding another symbol that is not ${{{R}}}$.

Second, it is also true that there is always a more compact alternative to using a grammar that contains every member of $\Sigma_E^n$.
Suppose that you have a positive grammar that contains every possible $n$-gram over $\Sigma_E$, where $n \geq 2$.
In this case, the grammar generates $\Sigma^*$, the set of all possible strings over $\Sigma$.
But $\Sigma^*$ could have just as well been defined by a negative grammar $G$ that forbids no $n$-grams at all (formally, $G = \emptyset$).
Similarly, suppose that you have a negative grammar that contains every possible $n$-gram over $\Sigma_E$, with $n \geq 2$.
In this grammar, nothing is allowed at all, not even the empty string, so the grammar generates the empty language $\emptyset$.
But the empty language could also be generated by the positive $n$-gram grammar $G$ that contains no $n$-grams at all (formally, $G = \emptyset$).

The same strategy of switching polarities can be used to show that for every $n$-grammar $G$ that contains more than half of all possible $n$-grams (rounded up) there is a smaller grammar of opposite polarity that generates the same string language as $G$.
