This section defines both negative and positive versions of $n$-gram grammars and shows that they are expressively equivalent.
Like in the section on the equivalence of mixed and fixed $n$-gram grammars, this is accomplished by a **constructive** proof.
A proof is constructive if it doesn't just derive the existence of some object, but gives a concrete procedure for constructing this object.
In the case at hand, the proof shows how to construct a positive grammar from a negative one, and the other way around.

::: definition
Let $\Sigma$ be some alphabet, and $\Sigma_E$ its extension with edge marker symbols ${{{L}}}, {{{R}}} \notin \Sigma$.
An $n$-gram over $\Sigma_E$ is an element of $\Sigma_E^n$ ($n \geq 1$).
An $n$-gram grammar $G$ over alphabet $\Sigma$ is a finite set of $n$-grams over $\Sigma_E$.
Every $n$-gram grammar has a **polarity**:

- If $G$ is negative (also denoted $^-G$), then a string $s$ over $\Sigma$ is well-formed with respect to $^-G$ iff there are no $u, v$ over $\Sigma_E$ and no $g \in ^-G$ such that ${{{L}}}^{n-1} \stringcat s \stringcat {{{R}}}^{n-1} = u \stringcat g \stringcat v$.
- If $G$ is positive (also denoted $^+G$), then a string $s$ over $\Sigma$ is well-formed with respect to $^+G$ iff for all $u, v$ over $\Sigma_E$ and $g \in \Sigma_E^n$ such that ${{{L}}}^{n-1} \stringcat s \stringcat {{{R}}}^{n-1} = u \stringcat g \stringcat v$, it holds that $g \in ^+G$.

The **language of $G$**, denoted $L(G)$, contains all strings that are well-formed with respect to $G$, and only those.

::: theorem
For every $n$-gram grammar $G$ there exists a grammar $G'$ of opposite polarity such that $L(G) = L(G')$.

::: proof
We assume w.l.o.g. that $G$ is a positive grammar and denote it by $P$.
We define a negative counterpart $N$ as $\Sigma_E^n - P$ and show that $L(P) = L(N)$.

First, every $s \in L(P)$ is necessarily a member of $L(N)$.
Assume towards a contradiction that $s \notin L(N)$.
Then there must be some $g \in N$ such that ${{{L}}}^{n-1} s {{{R}}}^{n-1} = u \stringcat g \stringcat v$ ($u,v, \in \Sigma_E^*$).
But since $N \is \Sigma_E^n - P$, $g \in N$ implies $g \notin P$, wherefore $s \notin L(P)$.
As this contradicts our initial assumption that $s \in L(P)$, it cannot be the case that $s \notin L(N)$.
So $s \in L(N)$ after all.

In the other direction, suppose that $s \notin L(P)$.
Then by definition there are $u, v \in \Sigma_E^*$ and $\Sigma_E^n \ni g \notin P$ such that ${{{L}}}^{n-1} s {{{R}}}^{n-1} = u \stringcat g \stringcat v$.
But then $g \in N$, which entails $s \notin L(N)$.

This shows that $s \in L(P)$ iff $s \in L(N)$.
As $s$ was arbitrary, this holds for all strings and establishes $L(P) = L(N)$, which concludes our proof.
