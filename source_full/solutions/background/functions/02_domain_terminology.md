# Domains and co-domains

::: exercise
Suppose that $f$ is still defined by $f(x) = x + 1$, but we have $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$.
For each one of the following, say whether it is defined or undefined.

1. $f(0)$: defined
1. $f(-1)$: defined
1. $f(-2)$: undefined ($-1 \notin \mathbb{N}$)
1. $f(2.5)$: undefined ($3.5 \notin \mathbb{N}$)

::: example
When a car wash is viewed as a function, its domain is the set of all cars (both dirty and clean), whereas the co-domain only contains clean cars.
:::

::: exercise
What would be the domain and co-domain of a broken car wash that fails to remove even the tiniest speck of dirt?
:::

::: solution
The domain and co-domain would both be the set of all cars.
Though one could argue that a car wash can wash a lot more than just cars, so the domain and co-domain should perhaps be the set of all material objects.
