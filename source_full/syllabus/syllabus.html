<h1 id="course-outline">Course Outline</h1>
<h2 id="bulletin-description">Bulletin Description</h2>
<p>An overview of the mathematical foundations of theoretical and
computational linguistics. Topics covered include set theory, morphisms,
logic and model theory, algebra, lattices, lambda calculus, probability
theory, information theory, and basics of formal language theory. A
strong emphasis is put on the linguistic application of the mathematical
concepts in the study and analysis of natural language data.</p>
<h2 id="full-description">Full Description</h2>
<p>This course is an introduction to mathematics in linguistics. It aims
to help students familiarize themselves with mathematical concepts and
applications that are widely relevant to theoretical andor computational
linguistics. This covers a wide range of topics, mostly from
<em>discrete mathematics</em>. All the concepts will be illustrated with
examples that have to do with natural language. For linguistics
students, this should make the math more approachable and engaging. For
mathematics students, this will show you a little-known but fascinating
application area for mathematics.</p>
<p>The course is also very different from what you did in high school,
there’s precious few numbers here and we don’t care much about
trigonometry or calculating compound interest. In contrast to a proper
mathematics course, we also focus more on techniques and tools rather
than theorems and proofs. This means that you will learn how to work
with things like functions, matrices, lattices, and finite-state
automata, but you won’t have to prove things about them. So this is more
like a CS methods course than a proper math class.</p>
<p>For more information about the content, see the <a
href="#Selected-Topics">Selected Topics</a> section. You will see that
the schedule for this class is very ambitious. We probably won’t be able
to cover everything (I have taught this course many times, and I never
made it all the way to the end). But no matter how far we get, by the
end of the class you should have had enough exposure to mathematical
thinking that the thought of picking up a textbook in mathematics or
computational linguistics for self-study won’t make you run away in
horror.</p>
<h2 id="teaching-goals">Teaching Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>master essential concepts and techniques in mathematics and
theoretical computer science</li>
<li>apply mathematical techniques to the study of language</li>
<li>formalize linguistic ideas in mathematical terms</li>
<li>develop learning autonomy and the ability to expand your
mathematical knowledge through self-study</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>No prior mathematical or computational experience is required. We
will get to see quite a bit of mathematical notation, like
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>→</mo><mo>¬</mo><mi>a</mi><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><mo>→</mo><mo>¬</mo><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(a \rightarrow \neg a) \rightarrow \neg a</annotation></semantics></math>
or
<math display="block" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd columnalign="center"><mn>1</mn></mtd><mtd columnalign="center"><mn>0</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign="center"><mn>0</mn></mtd><mtd columnalign="center"><mn>0</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><mo>⊗</mo><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mtable><mtr><mtd columnalign="center"><mn>0</mn></mtd><mtd columnalign="center"><mn>0</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd columnalign="center"><mn>1</mn></mtd><mtd columnalign="center"><mn>1</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 0\\0 &amp; 0\\\end{pmatrix} \otimes \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0\\1 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math>
But you don’t need to know yet what any of that means.</p>
<p>There’s no linguistic prereqs either, but since I’m a linguist I
might sometimes forget what parts of linguistics are not common
knowledge. Don’t feel shy to ask clarification questions. Anecdotal
evidence: I have run this course as an independent study with high
school students who had no prior experience in linguistics, and they
could follow along just fine because they were not afraid to ask me to
clarify some linguistic concepts.</p>
<h2 id="textbook">Textbook</h2>
<p>None, but there are detailed lecture notes that will eventually
become a textbook. The lecture notes will be made available as PDFs and
HTML. Detailed instructions will follow in a separate announcement.</p>

<h1 id="grading">Grading</h1>
<h2 id="undergraduate-students">Undergraduate students</h2>
<p>By default, 100% of your grade is determined by a (take-home) final
exam. But there are various things you can do throughout the semester to
reduce the importance of the final exam. This way, students who would
rather study on their own can just do that and get their grade by
demonstrating their knowledge on the final exam. Students who
participate more regularly instead get to minimize the risk that a bad
final exam will ruin their grade.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Class participation (10%)</strong><br />
Show up all the time, ask questions and participate in discussion, and
you will get an A for class participation. That A makes up 10% of your
grade.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pre-assessment (P/F; 5%)</strong><br />
At the beginning of the semester, students are asked to take a survey to
assess their prior knowledge of mathematical linguistics. It is
perfectly normal not to know a single answer. Bring the completed survey
to the first session of week 2. Performance is P/F depending on whether
a filled-out survey was submitted (answering “Don’t know” on each
question is perfectly fine). If you get a P, that is treated like an A
and is worth 5% of your grade.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weekly assignments (P/F; 3% each)</strong><br />
A list of exercises from the lecture notes is assigned every Thursday
and your answers are due the following Tuesday. You should make a
reasonable effort to complete the exercises, but your answers are not
really graded. As long as it is clear that you made an effort, you get a
P, which is treated as an A and is worth 3% of your grade. There will be
around 10 assignments in total, making up 0% to 30% of your grade.</p>
<p>Full solutions will be distributed each Thursday together with the
next assignment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Take-home midterm (percentage graded; 30%)</strong><br />
We will have a midterm, but they won’t be taken in class. Instead, the
midterm takes the form of an extra-long homework assignment. If your
grade on the midterm is higher than the grade on the final exam, it
makes up 30% of your grade. If it is lower, we simply drop it and it
does not factor into your grade (if you bomb the midterm but then shape
up and turn in a great final exam, that’s something to be rewarded, not
punished).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Post-assessment (P/F; 5%)</strong><br />
Exactly the same as the pre-assessment. Just do it again, pat yourself
on the shoulder for every question you now know the answer to, and then
hand it in with the final exam.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Take-home final (percentage graded;
remainder)</strong><br />
Same deal as the midterm, but even longer and you get two weeks to work
on it.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="graduate-students">Graduate students</h2>
<p>The grading is the same as for undergrads, except that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The weekly assignments may contain exercises that are optional
for undergrads but mandatory for grads.</p></li>
<li><p>Once during the semester, you have to serve as pseudo-grader. You
will get to look at half of the assignments, then you will meet with the
TA to discuss what you think the students did well, what they struggled
with, and who (if anybody) you think should not get a P due to lack of
effort.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="student-pseudonyms">Student pseudonyms</h2>
<p>Because the grad students in this course will get to look at the
handed-in assignments, we will put in place an extra measure to protect
your privacy. At the beginning of the semester, you will pick a
pseudonym, and whenever you hand in an assignment, you will use that
pseudonym instead of your real name. Detailed instructions will be sent
out in a separate announcement.</p>
<h2 id="chat-gpt">Chat GPT</h2>
<p>You are allowed to use Chat GPT for assignments and the final exam,
but if you do so, please indicate that you did. It won’t matter for
grading or anything else, but I would like to know whether students
actually benefit from using Chat GPT. Here is some advice based on my
own experimentation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Do not blindly copy-paste answers from Chat GPT. Treat it like a
discussion with a peer, be aware that said peer may well be wrong, then
write up your own answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Chat GPT will often get things wrong, in particular on the
exercises that combine math and linguistics. But it can be insightful to
think about what it got wrong, and why. Contrast what Chat GPT does
against the official solutions for exercises, and you may have quite a
few epiphanies.</p></li>
<li><p>Use Chat GPT selectively. It can take a lot of time to convert an
exercise into a prompt that Chat GPT can do something with. It’s often
faster to just do things by yourself. Use Chat GPT for the exercises
that really have you stymied, the exercises where you don’t even know
how to get started.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-remark-on-grades">A remark on grades</h2>
<p>Yes, this class has a grading system that is easy to game. You could
do nothing the whole semester and then spend a day with Chat GPT to
write up your take-home final. But that means you’ll have paid the
university a decent sum of money on a course that you learnt nothing
from. If you’re okay with that, then I’m okay with that, just like your
gym doesn’t mind that you pay them fifty bucks a month but never show
up.</p>
<p>My experience is that the students who shouldn’t get a good grade
somehow manage to get a low grade even under the most lenient grading
system. No reason to tighten clamps that will only make things more
annoying for students who do just fine without all those extra hoops to
jump through.</p>
