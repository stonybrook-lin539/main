<h1 id="semilattices">(Semi)Lattices</h1>
<p>Posets are already a special kind of structure. Among all the
possible ways of defining a relation over a set, only those yield a
poset where the relation is a partial order. But some posets are even
more special because they furnish particular upper or lower bounds for
the elements of the poset. These posets are called
<strong>semilattices</strong> and <strong>lattices</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="greatest-lower-bounds-and-least-upper-bounds">Greatest lower
bounds and least upper bounds</h2>
<p>The previous unit was only concerned with identifying lower bounds
and upper bounds, but not all lower bounds and upper bounds are the
same. Some are “closer” to the elements whose bounds we want to compute.
This gives us the notion of <strong>greatest lower bound</strong> and
<strong>least upper bound</strong>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>We return once more to the poset of subsets of <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,3 \right \}\)</span> ordered by the
subset relation <span class="math inline">\(\subseteq\)</span>. We have
already seen that the upper bounds of <span class="math inline">\(\left
\{ 1 \right \}\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1
\right \}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2 \right
\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,3 \right
\}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,3 \right
\}\)</span>. And the lower bounds of <span class="math inline">\(\left
\{ 1 \right \}\)</span> are the empty set and <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1 \right \}\)</span> itself.</p>
<p><img src="lattice_123_bounds1.svg"
alt="lattice_123_bounds1.svg" /></p>
<p>Among those lower bounds, the greatest lower bound is <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1 \right \}\)</span> because it is
closest to <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1 \right \}\)</span>.
And the least upper bound is also <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1
\right \}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>We also know already that given the poset above, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{ub}(\left \{ \left \{ 2 \right \}, \left
\{ 3 \right \}, \left \{ 2,3 \right \} \right \}) = \left \{ \left \{
2,3 \right \}, \left \{ 1,2,3 \right \} \right \}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{lb}(\left \{ \left \{ 2 \right \}, \left
\{ 3 \right \}, \left \{ 2,3 \right \} \right \}) = \left \{ \emptyset
\right \}\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="lattice_123_bounds2-3-23.svg"
alt="lattice_123_bounds2-3-23.svg" /></p>
<p>In this case, the least upper bound is <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 2,3 \right \}\)</span> because <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 2,3 \right \}\)</span> is less than <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,3 \right \}\)</span> (we have <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 2,3 \right \} \subseteq \left \{ 1,2,3
\right \}\)</span>). The greatest lower bound is <span
class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span> because there was only one
lower bound to begin with.</p>
</div>
<p>Looking at those examples, you might have already noticed a peculiar
connection. The greatest lower bounds of some subset <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> are exactly the upper bounds of the
lower bounds of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. And the least
upper bounds of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> are exactly the
lower bounds of the upper bounds of <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Given a poset <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle S, \leq
\right \rangle\)</span> and some arbitrary subset <span
class="math inline">\(T \subseteq S\)</span>, we call <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{lub}(T)
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\mathrm{lb}(\mathrm{ub}(T))\)</span> the set of
<strong>least upper bounds</strong> of <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. An element of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{lub}(T)\)</span> is also called a
<strong>lub</strong> or a <strong>supremum</strong> or a
<strong>join</strong>. Similarly, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{glb}(T)
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\mathrm{ub}(\mathrm{lb}(T))\)</span> is the set of
<strong>greatest lower bounds</strong> of <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. An element of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{glb}(T)\)</span> is also called a
<strong>glb</strong> or an <strong>infimum</strong> or a
<strong>meet</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Let us return to the first example, where we saw that the set of
upper bounds of <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1 \right
\}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\left \{  \left \{ 1 \right
\}, \left \{ 1,2 \right \}, \left \{ 1,3 \right \}, \left \{ 1,2,3
\right \}  \right \}\)</span> while the least upper bound of <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1 \right \}\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1 \right \}\)</span> itself. Following
our definition, we compute the lub as <span
class="math display">\[\mathrm{lub}(\left \{ \left \{ 1 \right \} \right
\}) = \mathrm{lb}(\mathrm{ub}(\left \{ \left \{ 1 \right \} \right \}))
= \mathrm{lb}(\left \{  \left \{ 1 \right \}, \left \{ 1,2 \right \},
\left \{ 1,3 \right \}, \left \{ 1,2,3 \right \}  \right \}) = \left \{
\left \{ 1 \right \} \right \}.\]</span> This tells us that <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1 \right \}\)</span> is the only lub of
<span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1 \right \}\)</span>, as
expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Given the same poset as in the previous examples, compute all of the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{lub}(\left \{ \left \{ 1,2
\right \}, \left \{ 2,3 \right \} \right \})\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{glb}(\left \{ \left \{ 1,2
\right \}, \left \{ 2,3 \right \} \right \})\)</span></li>

<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{lub}(\left \{ \left \{ 1 \right
\}, \left \{ 2 \right \}, \left \{ 3 \right \} \right \})\)</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="uniqueness-of-lubs-and-glbs">Uniqueness of lubs and glbs</h2>
<p>In the examples so far, there has always been a unique lub and a
unique glb. But this isn’t always the case with posets.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>We have already seen in the previous units that some posets may not
have any lower bounds or upper bounds for at least some subsets of the
carrier.</p>
<p><img src="poset_nobounds.svg" alt="poset_nobounds.svg" /></p>
<p>If there’s no lower bounds or upper bounds, then there can’t be any
greatest lower bounds or least upper bounds either.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>With the poset below, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{ub}(S)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{lb}(S)\)</span> are non-empty for any
non-empty subset <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> of the carrier.
That is to say, any collection of one or more elements has at least one
upper bound and at least one lower bound.</p>
<p><img src="poset_nouniquemeet.svg" alt="poset_nouniquemeet.svg" /></p>
<p>However, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{lub}(\left \{ c,d \right
\})\)</span> is actually empty. To see this, we first compute <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{ub}(\left \{ c,d \right \}) = \left \{
a,b,e \right \}\)</span>. We next calcuate <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{lb}(\left \{ a,b,e \right \})\)</span>,
which is the empty set because there is no <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\left \{
a,b,e \right \}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x \leq
y\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(y \in \left \{ a,b,e
\right \}\)</span>. Putting these two results together, we get <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{lub}(\left \{ c,d \right \}) =
\emptyset\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The reasoning in the example above can be used to prove a powerful
result: lubs and glbs are unique.</p>
<div class="proposition">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> be a subset of the carrier
of some poset <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle S, \leq \right
\rangle\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{lub}(T) \neq
\emptyset\)</span>, then it contains exactly one element. If <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{glb}(T) \neq \emptyset\)</span>, then it
contains exactly one element.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Try to explain to yourself why this result holds.</p>
<p><em>Hint</em>: Suppose towards a contradiction that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{lub}(T)\)</span> does contain at least two
distinct elements <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. How would <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> have to be ordered by <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>? Is this possible in a poset?</p>
</div>
<p>Since lubs and glbs are unique, it is often convenient to assume that
the functions <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{lub}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{glb}\)</span> return this unique
element rather than a set containing the element. Quite generally, we
can reduce the use of sets in the notation by quite a bit. It is often
convenient to write <span class="math inline">\(x \vee y\)</span> as a
shorthand for <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{lub}(\left \{ x,y
\right \})\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(x \wedge y\)</span>
as a shorthand for <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{glb}(x,
y)\)</span>. If you didn’t like notation like <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{glb}(\left \{  \left \{ 1 \right \}, \left
\{ 2 \right \}  \right \})\)</span>, you can now rejoice because you
have the more legible alternative <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1
\right \} \wedge \left \{ 2 \right \}\)</span>. The notation can be
generalized such that <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{lub}(\left \{
s_1, \ldots, s_n \right \}) = s_1 \vee s_2 \vee \cdots \vee
s_n\)</span>, and similarly for <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{glb}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\wedge\)</span>. The operations <span
class="math inline">\(\vee\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\wedge\)</span> are referred to as
<strong>join</strong> and <strong>meet</strong>.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Writing <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{glb}(\left \{ s_1,
\ldots, s_n \right \})\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(s_1
\wedge s_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge s_n\)</span> is possible because <span
class="math inline">\(\wedge\)</span> is an associative operation: <span
class="math inline">\((x \wedge y) \wedge z = x \wedge (y \wedge
z)\)</span>. Explain why <span class="math inline">\(\wedge\)</span> is
associative.</p>
<p><em>Hint</em>: You want to show that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{glb}(\left \{  \mathrm{glb}(\left \{ x, y
\right \}), z \right \}) = \mathrm{glb}(\left \{ x, \mathrm{glb}(\left
\{ y, z \right \}) \right \})\)</span> if one adopts the convention that
the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{glb}\)</span> function returns a
unique element rather than a set.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>A quick remark on terminology: beginners often confuse the symbols
<span class="math inline">\(\vee\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\wedge\)</span>. There’s multiple tricks that
might help you remember which is which.</p>
<p>First, think of the poset of subsets of <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,3 \right \}\)</span> we had in the
first example of this unit. In this lattice, intersecting two elements
(<span class="math inline">\(\cap\)</span>) is the same as taking their
meet (<span class="math inline">\(\wedge\)</span>), whereas taking their
union (<span class="math inline">\(\cup\)</span>) is the same as taking
their join (<span class="math inline">\(\vee\)</span>). So the symbols
for meet and join mirror those for intersection and union.</p>
<p>In addition, you can think of the meet operation as looking at all
the lower bounds below and limiting them to just one at the very top,
just like <span class="math inline">\(\wedge\)</span> is broad at the
bottom and has only enough room for one thing at the top. The join
operation <span class="math inline">\(\vee\)</span> is the mirror image
of that. We look at the upper bounds above and limit it to just one
thing at the very bottom.</p>
<p>Finally, the meet symbol <span class="math inline">\(\wedge\)</span>
looks like one half of the letter <em>m</em> at the beginning of
<em>meet</em>. And <span class="math inline">\(\vee\)</span> is the
final part of the final letter <em>n</em> of <em>join</em>. This is
perhaps the hokiest way of memorizing the symbols, but it’s the one that
worked best for me back in the days.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="semilattices-1">(Semi)Lattices</h2>
<p>As we have seen, not every poset furnishes a join or a meet for every
subset of the carrier. The posets that do are particularly well-behaved
and hence get special terms: <strong>join semilattice</strong> and
<strong>meet semilattice</strong>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A poset <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle S, \leq \right
\rangle\)</span> is a <strong>join semilattice</strong> iff <span
class="math inline">\(x \vee y\)</span> exists for all <span
class="math inline">\(x, y \in S\)</span>. It is a <strong>meet
semilattice</strong> iff <span class="math inline">\(x \wedge y\)</span>
exists for all <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in S\)</span>. It is a
<strong>semilattice</strong> iff is a join semilattice or a meet
semilattice.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following depictions of a poset, say whether it
is a join semilattice, a meet semilattice, both, or neither.</p>
</div>
<p>In practice, the distinction between join and meet semilattices isn’t
all that relevant. You can convert between join semilattices and meet
semilattices by reversing the order: <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} y\)</span> becomes <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R}
x\)</span>. In terms of drawings, that’s the same as flipping the
semilattice upside-down, or rotating it by 180 degrees.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the poset whose carrier contains the sets <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1 \right \}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 2 \right \}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2 \right \}\)</span>, ordered by the
subset relation <span class="math inline">\(\subseteq\)</span>. This is
a join semilattice. It is not a meet semilattice because <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1 \right \}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 2 \right \}\)</span> have no meet.
However, we can just replace <span
class="math inline">\(\subseteq\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(\supseteq\)</span>. Now the poset is no longer a
join semilattice, but it is a meet semilattice.</p>
<p><img src="semilattice_switch.svg" alt="semilattice_switch.svg" /></p>
</div>
<p>Some posets are so well-behaved that they are both join semilattices
and meet semilattices. These posets are <strong>lattices</strong>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A poset is a <strong>lattice</strong> iff it is both a join
semilattice and a meet semilattice.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The poset of subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,3
\right \}\)</span> ordered by the subset relation <span
class="math inline">\(\subseteq\)</span> is a lattice. That’s because it
is both a join semilattice and a meet semilattice. We cannot really show
this manually here, since we would have to check for any collection of
elements that is has a unique join and a unique meet. And with <span
class="math inline">\(8\)</span> elements, there would be <span
class="math inline">\(2^8 = 256\)</span> combinations, and for each one
we would have to compute join and meet to ensure that it exists and is
unique.</p>
<p>Rather than brute-forcing it like this, it is better to think about
the nature of the poset. First of all, we only need to show that there
is a unique join and a unique meet for any two elements of the poset
(because as pointed out above, join and meet are associative). The
ordering relation of the poset is subset, and the carrier includes all
possible subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,3 \right
\}\)</span>. Given two sets <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, their least upper bound will be
equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(A \cup B\)</span>, and their
greatest lower bound will be the same as <span class="math inline">\(A
\cap B\)</span>. We know that <span class="math inline">\(A \cap
B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A \cup B\)</span> always
exist, and we know that they cannot produce any sets that aren’t subsets
of <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,3 \right \}\)</span>. This
ensures that there is always a unique join and a unique meet.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The poset <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle \mathbb{N}, \leq
\right \rangle\)</span> of natural numbers ordered by <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> in the usual fashion is also a
lattice. In this case there would be infinitely many cases to check, so
again we cannot brute-force this by looking at all possible cases. And
once again it is sufficient to consider the join and meet of two
arbitrary elements. Pick two such numbers <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> is a total order, either <span
class="math inline">\(m \leq n\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(n
\leq m\)</span> have to hold. Assume the former. Then <span
class="math inline">\(m \wedge n = m\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(m \vee n = n\)</span>. Once again we get a unique
solution for join and meet that is guaranteed to exist no matter how
<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> are chosen.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The poset <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{2}\)</span> of truth
values is also a lattice.</p>
<p><img src="lattice_2.svg" alt="lattice_2.svg" /></p>
<p>In this case, the lattice is small enough to verify by hand that meet
and join exist in all relevant cases, which are <span
class="math inline">\(T \wedge T\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(T
\wedge F\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(F \wedge F\)</span>
(and similarly for <span class="math inline">\(\vee\)</span>).</p>
