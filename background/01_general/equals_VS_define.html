<p>I assume that you have all seen the “equals” sign <span
class="math inline">\(=\)</span> before, as in <span
class="math inline">\(1 + 1 = 2\)</span>. You have probably also seen
usages such as <em>Compute <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> for
<span class="math inline">\(x = 5\)</span></em>. These are actually two
very distinct uses of <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span>.</p>
<p>In <span class="math inline">\(1 + 1 = 2\)</span>, the equals sign
expresses an equality. An equality may or may not hold, and a statement
about equality may be true or false. While <span class="math inline">\(1
+ 1 = 2\)</span> is in general a true statement when talking about
numbers, there can be cases when it is false. For example, in Boolean
matrix multiplication we cannot have values larger than 1 and hence
<span class="math inline">\(1 + 1 = 1\)</span>, which means that <span
class="math inline">\(1 + 1 = 2\)</span> would be false in that
case.</p>
<p>In our <span class="math inline">\(x = 5\)</span> example, on the
other hand, we are not saying that <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is equal to <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, we are defining <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to be <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. There is no way for this to be true or
false, you cannot tell me that I am wrong to define <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. I could have just as well defined it
to be <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(-35.3\)</span>, and there is nothing you could
have done to stop me. There is no way for you to show that <span
class="math inline">\(x = 5\)</span> is false.</p>
<p>In linguistic terms, the equals sign in <span class="math inline">\(1
+ 1 = 2\)</span> expresses a proposition, whereas in <span
class="math inline">\(x = 5\)</span> it expresses the speech act of
establishing in the discourse that the name <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> refers to the number <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. If you have some experience with
programming languages, then you can think of this as the difference
between a truth condition and a variable assignment. Mathematicians care
so much about this difference that they use two distinct symbols.
Equalities are expressed with <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span> as
usual, but the speech act meaning of <span
class="math inline">\(=\)</span> is denoted by <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrel{\mathop:}=\)</span> instead. Hence a
mathematician would not write “Suppose <span class="math inline">\(x =
5\)</span>” but rather “Suppose <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{\mathop:}=5\)</span>”.</p>
<p>Long story short: Don’t get confused when you see <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrel{\mathop:}=\)</span> instead of <span
class="math inline">\(=\)</span>, it simply means that you are looking
at a definition/variable assignment rather than an equality.</p>
