<h1 id="sets-the-basics">Sets: The basics</h1>
<p>Sets are the fundamental building block of modern mathematics.
Intuitively, a set is a collection of objects, but with two important
twists:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sets are unordered.</li>
<li>Sets contain no duplicates.</li>
</ol>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose you want to keep a record of which words occur in a text. You
aren’t interested in how often a given word occurred, just whether it
occurs at all. Nor do you care in which order the words occurred in the
text. So you are actually interested in the <em>set</em> of words that
occur in the text.</p>
</div>
<p>Each property is explained in detail below, but let’s first put some
helpful notation in place.</p>
<h2 id="list-notation">List notation</h2>
<p>Sets are often written as lists with curly braces around them. So
<span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a, b, c, d \right \}\)</span>
denotes the set containing <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Here <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>
are some arbitrary objects. This is known as <strong>list
notation</strong>. More complex sets are defined with
<strong>set-builder notation</strong>, which will be covered in a later
unit. <!-- fixme: add link to unit --></p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the string <em>If John slept, then Mary left</em>. Its set
of words (ignoring sentence-initial capitalization) is <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{  \text{if}, \text{John}, \text{left},
\text{Mary}, \text{slept}, \text{then}  \right \}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Write the following as a set:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first names of your three favorite actors/actresses,</li>
<li>the colors of the rainbow,</li>
<li>all even numbers between 1 and 11</li>
</ul>
<div class="solution">
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\{\)</span>Bruce, Marlene, Bela<span
class="math inline">\(\}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\{\)</span>red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo, violet<span class="math inline">\(\}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 2,4,6,8,10 \right
\}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="solution_explained">
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Suppose that your favorite actors are Bruce Campbell (<em>Evil
Dead</em>), Marlene Dietrich (<em>The Blue Angel</em>, <em>Witness for
the Prosecution</em>), and Bela Lugosi (<em>Dracula</em>). Their first
names are <em>Bruce</em>, <em>Marlene</em>, and <em>Bela</em>, so the
set that contains their first names, and nothing else, is <span
class="math inline">\(\{\)</span>Bruce, Marlene, Bela<span
class="math inline">\(\}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re like me, you probably had to look this one up, but
rainbows have six colors, which are red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
indigo, and violet. So the set we’re looking for contains these six
colors. We can specify that set using the names of these colors, but it
would also be okay to use colored squares instead of names, colored
lines, anything that conveys clearly that this is the set that contains
these six colors.</p></li>
<li><p>A number is even if and only if it is a multiple of 2. Between 1
and 11, that’s 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="elements-and-set-membership">Elements and set membership</h2>
<p>The objects contained in a set are called its
<strong>elements</strong> or <strong>members</strong>. One writes <span
class="math inline">\(e \in S\)</span> to indicate that <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is an element of <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. The opposite is denoted <span
class="math inline">\(e \notin S\)</span>: <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is not an element of <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. The symbol <span
class="math inline">\(\in\)</span> thus indicates <strong>set
membership</strong>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> be the set of words in the
string <em>If John slept, then Mary left</em>. Then it holds that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{left} \in W\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{right} \notin W\)</span>. But it is not
the case that <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{then} \notin
W\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{awake} \in
W\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>You might be wondering why we use the symbol <span
class="math inline">\(\in\)</span> for set membership. The following
mnemonic, while historically inaccurate, may help you with remembering
the notation: <span class="math inline">\(\in\)</span> looks like a
stylized <em>E</em>, and <span class="math inline">\(x \in S\)</span>
means that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is an <em>E</em>lement
of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<p>Sometimes <span class="math inline">\(\ni\)</span> is used as the
mirror image of <span class="math inline">\(\in\)</span>. For example,
<span class="math inline">\(a \in S\)</span> could also be written as
<span class="math inline">\(S \ni a\)</span>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Continuing the previous example, it is true that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{left} \in W \ni \mathit{then}\)</span>.
That is to say, both <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{left} \in
W\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{then} \in W\)</span>
are true.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Put <span class="math inline">\(\in\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\ni\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\notin\)</span>, <span

appropriate:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(5 \_ \left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right

<li><span class="math inline">\(6 \_ \left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right

<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 5 \right \} \_ \left \{
1,2,4,5,8 \right \}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(5 \_ \left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right \} \_
6\)</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="solution">
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(5 \in \left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right
\}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(6 \notin \left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right
\}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 5 \right \} \notin \left \{
1,2,4,5,8 \right \}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(5 \in \left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right \}
\notin 6\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(5 \in \left \{
1,2,4,5,8 \right \} \not\ni 6\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="solution_explained">
<ol type="1">
<li>The set <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right
\}\)</span> has 5 as one of its members, which we write as <span
class="math inline">\(5 \in \left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right \}\)</span>.</li>
<li>On the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> is nowhere
to be found in <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right
\}\)</span>, its only elements are <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(8\)</span>. Hence <span class="math inline">\(6
\notin \left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right \}\)</span>.</li>
<li>This one is a bit tricky. We already know that <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right \}\)</span> contains
<span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, but that’s not the same thing as
containing <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 5 \right \}\)</span>,
i.e. the set containing <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. None of
the elements of <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right
\}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 5 \right
\}\)</span>. By the way, this is also why <span class="math inline">\(5
\notin \left \{ 1,2,4,\left \{ 5 \right \},8 \right \}\)</span>. Never
confuse an object with a set containing that object, the two are very
different things.</li>
<li>We already know that <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8
\right \}\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, so
the first gap must be <span class="math inline">\(\in\)</span>. For the
second gap, there are two options. If we fill the gap with <span
class="math inline">\(\notin\)</span>, we are saying that <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right \}\)</span> is not a
member of <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>, which is true, but
it’s an odd thing to say as <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> isn’t
a set to begin with. Instead, it makes more sense to fill the gap with
<span class="math inline">\(\not\ni\)</span>, which states that <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span> is not a member of <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right \}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sets can contain arbitrary objects, including other sets. However,
the members of a set are just the elements immediately contained by the
set, not what might in turn be contained inside of those elements.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The set <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a, \left \{ b \right \}
\right \}\)</span> has two members: <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left
\{ b \right \}\)</span>. While <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is
an element of <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ b \right \}\)</span>,
it is not an element of <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a, \left \{
b \right \} \right \}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">

<li><span class="math inline">\(5 \notin \left \{ \left \{ 1,2,4,5,8
\right \} \right \} \not\ni 6\)</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="solution_explained">
<p>This isn’t all too different from the previous exercise, we just have
to be careful not to get confused by all the set brackets.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We now have the <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1, \left \{ 2,4
\right \}, 5, 8 \right \}\)</span> instead of <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 \right \}\)</span> from the
previous exercise, but this difference doesn’t matter for the set
membership of <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>.</li>
<li>This is another straightforward one where the change between the two
exercises doesn’t make a difference.</li>
<li>Here the change is important. Before, we saw that <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 5 \right \} \notin \left \{ 1,2,4,5,8
\right \}\)</span> because the latter contains only <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, which is distinct from <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 5 \right \}\)</span>. But now we do have
a set that actually contains the set containing <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>.</li>
<li>Here it is really important to read carefully. We are not dealing
with <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right \}\)</span>,
which is the set containing <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>
and nothing else. Instead, we have <span class="math inline">\(\left \{
\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right \} \right \}\)</span>. This set has only one
element, which is <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right
\}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>

</div>
</div>
<h2 id="lack-of-order">Lack of order</h2>
<p>Even though we may write sets in a linear fashion as lists, they have
no internal order. The set <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b
\right \}\)</span> could also be written as <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ b,a \right \}\)</span>. So we have <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b \right \} = \left \{ b,a \right
\}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b,c \right \}
=  \left \{ a,c,b \right \} =  \left \{ b,a,c \right \} =  \left \{
b,c,a \right \} =  \left \{ c,a,b \right \} =  \left \{ c,b,a \right
\}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the strings <em>If John slept, then Mary left</em> and
<em>If Mary left, then John slept</em>. While they are clearly distinct
sentences, their sets of words are identical.</p>

<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \{ b,a,c,d \right \} \neq \left \{
e,a,b,d \right \}\)</span> (assuming that <span

</ol>
<div class="solution_explained">
<ol type="1">
<li>Two sets are identical if they contain exactly the same elements.
This is clearly the case here, both sets contain <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, both of them also contain <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and they contain nothing else.</li>
<li>It may seem like <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ b,a \right
\}\)</span> is different from <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b
\right \}\)</span>, but remember that sets are unordered. It does not
matter in what order we write down the elements, all that matters is
whether the sets have the same members. And this is still the case
here.</li>
<li>Each one of the sets contains four elements, three of which are
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Only the first set contains <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, and only the second set contains <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span>. This suggests that the sets are not
equivalent. However, we have to be careful here as <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span> may just be different ways of referring
to the same object. As a concrete example, suppose that we are talking
about sets of actors, and we are looking at the sets <span
class="math inline">\(\{\)</span>Arnold<span
class="math inline">\(\}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\{\)</span>Schwarzenegger<span
class="math inline">\(\}\)</span>. These are not actually distinct sets,
they are just different ways of writing down the set that contains only
the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. So remember: what matters isn’t how we
choose to write down a set, what matters is what it actually contains.
If both <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span> are just ways of referring to, say, the
number <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, then the two sets above
are equivalent.</li>

<h2 id="lack-of-duplicatesidempotency">Lack of
duplicates/Idempotency</h2>
<p>Sets are <strong>idempotent</strong>, which means that duplicates are
ignored. So <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b \right \} = \left
\{ a,a,b \right \} = \left \{ a,b,b,a,b,a,b,a,a \right \}\)</span>. It
also holds that <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \} = \left
\{ a,a \right \} = \left \{ a,a,a \right \}\)</span>, and so on.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Linguists distinguish between <strong>word types</strong> and
<strong>word tokens</strong>. The sentence <em>dogs love dogs</em>
contain two tokens of the type <em>dogs</em>, and one token of the type
<em>love</em>. The sentences <em>dogs love</em> and <em>dogs love
dogs</em> are different with respect to word tokens, but identical with
respect to word types. So if you care about word types rather than word
tokens, you’re dealing with a set because the only thing that matters is
which words the text contains, not how many tokens of each word.</p>

through the string <em>If police[N] police[V] police[N], then police[N]
police[V] police[N]</em> (ignoring capitalization). The string starts
with <em>if</em>, so at this point our set is <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ \text{if} \right \}\)</span>. Next we see
<em>police[N]</em>, and since this is not in our set yet, we add it and
obtain <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ \text{if}, \text{police[N]}
\right \}\)</span>. After that we encounter <em>police[V]</em>, which is
not an element of our set yet — the set only contains the noun
<em>police</em>, not the verb <em>police</em>. Hence we add
<em>police[V]</em>, yielding <span class="math inline">\(\left \{
\text{if}, \text{police[N]}, \text{police[V]} \right \}\)</span>. Now
the next word is <em>police[N]</em>, but since that’s already in our set
we do not need to add it again (there’s no point in writing down the
same element multiple times). After that we add <em>then</em>, and at
this point we are done. Our set is <span class="math inline">\(\left \{
\text{if}, \text{police[N]}, \text{police[V]}, \text{then} \right
\}\)</span>, and our example sentence contains no words after
<em>then</em> that aren’t already members of this set.</p>

<p>It is important to keep in mind that idempotency only holds with
respect to the elements of a set, not what may be contained by those
elements.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Even though <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \} = \left
\{ a,a \right \}\)</span>, it is not the case that <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \} = \left \{ a, \left \{ a
\right \} \right \}\)</span>. The former is the set containing <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, the other is the set containing <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and the set of <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.</p>

<div class="solution_explained">
<ol type="1">
<li>Since <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is not the same as
<span class="math inline">\(\left \{ b \right \}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,a,b,\left \{ b \right \} \right
\}\)</span> contains an element that is not a member of <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b \right \}\)</span>, which means that
the two are distinct sets.</li>
<li>As sets do not contain duplicates, it holds that <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ \left \{ a \right \}, \left \{ b \right
\}, \left \{ a \right \} \right \} = \left \{ \left \{ a \right \},
\left \{ b \right \} \right \}\)</span>. But sets are also unordered, so
that <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ \left \{ a \right \}, \left \{
b \right \} \right \} = \left \{  \left \{ b \right \}, \left \{ a
\right \} \right \}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Again we have to keep in mind that sets do not contain duplicates,
and as a result <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,a \right \} =
\left \{ a \right \}\)</span>. We thus can simplify the two sets as
follows: <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ c,b,\left \{ a,a \right
\},d,c \right \} = \left \{ c,b,\left \{ a \right \},d,c \right \} =
\left \{ c,b,\left \{ a \right \}, d \right \} = \left \{ \left \{ a
\right \},b,c,d \right \}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left
\{ \left \{ a \right \},b,d,c,c,c \right \} = \left \{ \left \{ a \right
\},b,d,c \right \} = \left \{ \left \{ a \right \},b,c,d \right
\}\)</span>.</li>
<li>We can reduce <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,a,a,a,a,a,\left
\{ a \right \},a,a,a,a,a,a \right \}\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a, \left \{ a \right \} \right
\}\)</span>, but since <span class="math inline">\(a \neq \left \{ a
\right \}\)</span>, we can see that <span class="math inline">\(\left \{
a, \left \{ a \right \} \right \}\)</span> is not the same set as <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \}\)</span>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Sets are collections of arbitrary objects.</li>
<li>Sets are unordered and idempotent (= duplicates are ignored).</li>
<li>Sets can be defined with list notation, e.g. <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a, b \right \}\)</span>.</li>
<li>The objects contained in a set are called its <em>elements</em> or
<em>members</em>.</li>
<li>The symbols <span class="math inline">\(\in\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\notin\)</span> are used to indicate membership
and non-membership, respectively.</li>
<li>Occasionally, <span class="math inline">\(\ni\)</span> is used as
the mirror image of <span class="math inline">\(\in\)</span>.</li>
<li>While sets may contain objects that are themselves collections of
other objects, these objects inside objects are not considered for set
membership. Remember: <span class="math inline">\(a \in \left \{ a
\right \}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \}
\in \left \{ \left \{ a \right \} \right \}\)</span>, but <span
