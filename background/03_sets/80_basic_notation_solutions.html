<p>Write the following as a set:</p>

<li>the first names of your three favorite actors/actresses,</li>

<li><p>If you’re like me, you probably had to look this one up, but
rainbows have six colors, which are red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
indigo, and violet. So the set we’re looking for contains these six
colors. We can specify that set using the names of these colors, but it
would also be okay to use colored squares instead of names, colored
lines, anything that conveys clearly that this is the set that contains
these six colors.</p></li>

<div class="solution_explained">
<ol type="1">
<li>The set <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right
\}\)</span> has 5 as one of its members, which we write as <span
class="math inline">\(5 \in \left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right \}\)</span>.</li>
<li>On the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> is nowhere
to be found in <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right
\}\)</span>, its only elements are <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(8\)</span>. Hence <span class="math inline">\(6
\notin \left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right \}\)</span>.</li>
<li>This one is a bit tricky. We already know that <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right \}\)</span> contains
<span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, but that’s not the same thing as
containing <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 5 \right \}\)</span>,
i.e. the set containing <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>. None of
the elements of <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right
\}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 5 \right
\}\)</span>. By the way, this is also why <span class="math inline">\(5
\notin \left \{ 1,2,4,\left \{ 5 \right \},8 \right \}\)</span>. Never
confuse an object with a set containing that object, the two are very
different things.</li>
<li>We already know that <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8
\right \}\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, so
the first gap must be <span class="math inline">\(\in\)</span>. For the
second gap, there are two options. If we fill the gap with <span
class="math inline">\(\notin\)</span>, we are saying that <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right \}\)</span> is not a
member of <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span>, which is true, but
it’s an odd thing to say as <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> isn’t
a set to begin with. Instead, it makes more sense to fill the gap with
<span class="math inline">\(\not\ni\)</span>, which states that <span
class="math inline">\(6\)</span> is not a member of <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,4,5,8 \right \}\)</span>.</li>

<div class="solution_explained">
<ol type="1">
<li>Two sets are identical if they contain exactly the same elements.
This is clearly the case here, both sets contain <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, both of them also contain <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and they contain nothing else.</li>
<li>It may seem like <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ b,a \right
\}\)</span> is different from <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b
\right \}\)</span>, but remember that sets are unordered. It does not
matter in what order we write down the elements, all that matters is
whether the sets have the same members. And this is still the case
here.</li>
<li>Each one of the sets contains four elements, three of which are
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Only the first set contains <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, and only the second set contains <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span>. This suggests that the sets are not
equivalent. However, we have to be careful here as <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span> may just be different ways of referring
to the same object. As a concrete example, suppose that we are talking
about sets of actors, and we are looking at the sets <span
class="math inline">\(\{\)</span>Arnold<span
class="math inline">\(\}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\{\)</span>Schwarzenegger<span
class="math inline">\(\}\)</span>. These are not actually distinct sets,
they are just different ways of writing down the set that contains only
the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. So remember: what matters isn’t how we
choose to write down a set, what matters is what it actually contains.
If both <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(e\)</span> are just ways of referring to, say, the
number <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, then the two sets above
are equivalent.</li>

<li>Remember, one and the same element cannot be contained in a set
multiple times. Either it is a member of the set, or it is not a member,
it cannot be a member two times, or three times, or anything like that.
Hence <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,a,b,b \right \} = \left \{
a,b,b \right \} = \left \{ a,b \right \}\)</span>.</li>
<li>The same logic applies in this case: <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b,a \right \} = \left \{ a,b \right
\}\)</span>, which is the same as <span class="math inline">\(\left \{
b,a \right \}\)</span> because sets are not ordered.</li>
<li>Again we have two identical sets. The first set contains <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, and nothing else, and the same is true
for the second set.</li>
<li>Finally we have two sets that are distinct. The second set could be
written more compactly as <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,c
\right \}\)</span>, and that is not the same set as <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \}\)</span> because only the
former contains <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</li>

<div class="exercise">
<p>The sentence <em>If police police police, then police police
police</em> actually uses two different word types. It just just so
happens that both are pronounced and spelled <em>police</em>. But one is
the noun <em>police</em>, the other one the verb <em>police</em>. So we
might want to annotate the string as follows: <em>If police[N] police[V]
police[N], then police[N] police[V] police[N]</em>. Assume that words
are annotated with their part of speech in this fashion. Then what would
be the corresponding set of words?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p><span class="math inline">\(\left \{  \text{if}, \text{police[N]},
\text{police[V]}, \text{then}  \right \}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="solution_explained">
<p>We can build this set incrementally by moving from left to right
through the string <em>If police[N] police[V] police[N], then police[N]
police[V] police[N]</em> (ignoring capitalization). The string starts
with <em>if</em>, so at this point our set is <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ \text{if} \right \}\)</span>. Next we see
<em>police[N]</em>, and since this is not in our set yet, we add it and
obtain <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ \text{if}, \text{police[N]}
\right \}\)</span>. After that we encounter <em>police[V]</em>, which is
not an element of our set yet — the set only contains the noun
<em>police</em>, not the verb <em>police</em>. Hence we add
<em>police[V]</em>, yielding <span class="math inline">\(\left \{
\text{if}, \text{police[N]}, \text{police[V]} \right \}\)</span>. Now
the next word is <em>police[N]</em>, but since that’s already in our set
we do not need to add it again (there’s no point in writing down the
same element multiple times). After that we add <em>then</em>, and at
this point we are done. Our set is <span class="math inline">\(\left \{
\text{if}, \text{police[N]}, \text{police[V]}, \text{then} \right
\}\)</span>, and our example sentence contains no words after
<em>then</em> that aren’t already members of this set.</p>

<div class="solution_explained">
<ol type="1">
<li>Since <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is not the same as

the two are distinct sets.</li>
<li>As sets do not contain duplicates, it holds that <span

\left \{ b \right \} \right \}\)</span>. But sets are also unordered, so
that <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ \left \{ a \right \}, \left \{

<li>Again we have to keep in mind that sets do not contain duplicates,
and as a result <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,a \right \} =

follows: <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ c,b,\left \{ a,a \right

\left \{ c,b,\left \{ a \right \}, d \right \} = \left \{ \left \{ a

<li>We can reduce <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,a,a,a,a,a,\left
\{ a \right \},a,a,a,a,a,a \right \}\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a, \left \{ a \right \} \right
