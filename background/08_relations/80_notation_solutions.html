<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be the relation that

<ol type="1">
<li>Since an individual can be the parent of more than one individual,
this is a relation but not a function.</li>
<li>If we assume that everybody actually obeys this policy, and that the
policy has been active for so long that nobody who reached puberty
before the policy is still alive, then it is true for all individuals
currently alive that each one of them has at most one child. Hence the
parent-of relation for individuals currently alive would be a function.
(Of course, if we take “in a world” to include the whole history of
mankind, then this either includes cases of parents with multiple
children from before the policy was enacted, or mankind died out very
quickly because each generation’s size would be cut in half.)</li>
<li>If a car can be registered to multiple owners, then this is not a
function, but it is still a relation of course.</li>
<li>The prefix relation is not a function. For example, the string
<em>ab</em> is a prefix of infinitely many strings, including
<em>ab</em>, <em>aba</em>, <em>abab</em>, and so on.</li>

<div class="exercise">
<p>Is the following statement true or false? Justify your answer.</p>
<p>Every relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> can be regarded
as a function that maps <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>This statement is true. Suppose, for instance, <span
class="math inline">\(R \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  \left \langle a,b
\right \rangle, \left \langle a,c \right \rangle , \left \langle b,c
\right \rangle \right \}\)</span>. Then we may construct a new function
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(r(a) = \left \{ b,c \right \}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r(b) = \left \{ c \right \}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(r(c) = \emptyset\)</span>. This function <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> conveys the same information as <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>.</p>
<p>Reasoning a bit more abstractly: Let <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> be a function such that <span
class="math inline">\(r(x) = x \mathrel{R}\)</span>. First, it is indeed
the case that <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is a function
since, given how we defined <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>,
there can be no two <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(r(x) = y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r(x) = z\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y \neq z\)</span>. If there were two such <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, then that would mean that there are
two distinct sets that are both identical to <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R}\)</span>, which is impossible.
Second, we can construct a relation <span
class="math inline">\(R&#39;\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>: for every <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the domain of <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(R&#39;\)</span> contains every pair <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle x,y \right \rangle\)</span> such
that <span class="math inline">\(y \in r(x)\)</span>. But <span
class="math inline">\(R&#39;\)</span> is exactly the same as <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, which shows that we can freely switch
between the relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and the
function <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> as we see fit.</p>
