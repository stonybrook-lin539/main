intuition</h1>
<div class="prereqs">
<ul>
<li>relations (basic notation)</li>
<li>sets (basic notation)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>A binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> can be
combined with a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to define an
<strong>ordered set</strong>. Think of it as follows: whereas the
elements of a normal set are just floating around in limbo with no ties
between them, an ordered set uses some ordering relation <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> to lock its elements into place. This
unit only covers the intuition behind orders, and the formal definitions
are left to the next one.</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-ordered-sets">Examples of ordered sets</h2>
<div class="example">
<p>The standard way of reciting the alphabet in English can be regarded
as an order on the set <span class="math inline">\(\left \{
a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z \right
\}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The prototypical example of an order is the “equal or less than”
relation <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> over the set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> of natural numbers. While the
set of natural numbers is unordered, we can use <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> to define the usual order over it
with <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> at the beginning, followed
by <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, which is followed by <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, and so on.</p>
<p>We can draw this as a graph as in the figure below, where each node
is a number and we draw arrows between them to indicate their order. For
readability, we include the minimal number of arrows that are needed to
infer the order relation. For instance, we do not include an arrow from
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> because we already have an arrow from
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and another from <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, and we know that <span
class="math inline">\(0 \leq 1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1 \leq 2\)</span> implies <span
class="math inline">\(0 \leq 2\)</span> because of how the relation
<span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> works.</p>
<p><img src="natnum_lessthan.svg" alt="natnum_lessthan.svg" /></p>
<p>However, the full definition of <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> as a set of statements of the form
<span class="math inline">\(x \leq y\)</span> would still have to
include <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq 2\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(0 \leq 3\)</span>, and so on, even though those
could in principle be inferred. When we look at a relation of a set of
such statements, the set always contains all statements.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>We could have defined a very different kind of order over <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> be a function that maps each natural
number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to the recursive sum of
its digits. That is to say, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> first
sums up all the digits, then sums up the digits of the sum, and so on,
until only a single digit remains. The computation for <span
class="math inline">\(537\)</span>, for instance, would proceed as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(537: 5 + 3 + 7 = 15\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(15: 1 + 5 = 6\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Consequently, <span class="math inline">\(f(537) = 6\)</span>. Note
that <span class="math inline">\(f(537) = f(357) = f(753) = f(861) =
f(96) = f(15) = f(6)\)</span>, so many different numbers have the same
sum of digits. Now we define an order <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} y\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(f(x) &lt;
f(y)\)</span>. That’s a very different way of ordering the natural
numbers, but it’s still an order.</p>
<p>We can again visualize this order in terms of nodes connected by
arrows. For simplicity, we only consider the natural numbers from 0 to
45.</p>
<p><img src="natnum_digitsum.svg" alt="natnum_digitsum.svg" /></p>
<p>Intuitively speaking, the order splits the set of natural numbers
into 10 layers such that each layer represents one of the ten possible
values for the recursive digit sum function: 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on, all
the way up to 9. Each layer consists of all the numbers with the
corresponding recursive digit sum. For example, the layer of numbers
(from 0 to 45) whose recursive digit sum is 1 contains the numbers 1,
10, 19, 28, and 37. None of these numbers are ordered with respect to
each other, which is why they aren’t connected to each other by arrows.
But each number in this layer is ordered before each number in the layer
of numbers with recursive digit sum 2, and thus we have an arrow from
each number in layer 1 to each number in layer 2. It is also true that
each number in layer 1 is ordered before each number in layer 3, but
again we do not include these arrows in the figure because that would
unnecessary clutter to what is already a very busy figure.</p>
<p>If we were to expand the figure to properly depict this order for all
natural numbers, the figure would still have the geometry above in terms
of 10 layers where layers for lower digit sums are ordered before layers
with higher digit sums. What would change, though, is that each layer
would have to contain infinitely many numbers. For instance, layer 1
would contain 1, 10, 19, 28, 37, 46, 55, 64, 73, 82, 91, 100, 109, 118,
127, 136, and so on. Obviously it is impossible to actually draw an
infinitely large layer, which is why the figure only depicts an
illustrative part of the whole order.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="not-every-binary-relation-is-an-order">Not every binary relation
is an order</h2>
<p>The essential aspect of orders is that they allow us to say that some
element is in some sense less relevant or prominent than some other
element. The <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> relation, for
instance, orders numbers from small to big. We are effectively ranking
the elements of the set.</p>
<p>Not every binary relation gives rise to such a ranking.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose that we define the following binary relation <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> over the set <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,3 \right \}\)</span> of person
features: <span class="math inline">\(1 \mathrel{R} 2\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(1 \mathrel{R} 3\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(2 \mathrel{R} 3\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(3 \mathrel{R} 2\)</span>. That’s not really a
ranking. Yes, we can see that <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is
ranked higher than <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> (or lower, depending on how you look at
it). But <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span> are not clearly ranked with respect to
each other. On the one hand <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is
higher than <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, and on the other
hand <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> is higher than <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. We have a kind of cycle, and that’s
not okay for orders.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Now consider the successor relation <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> over natural numbers. Here <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{S} y\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(y = x + 1\)</span>. So we have <span
class="math inline">\(0 \mathrel{S} 1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(1 \mathrel{S} 2\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(2 \mathrel{S} 3\)</span>, and so on. Even though
this might look like it generates the same order as <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, it’s not an order at all. The
problem is that the relation does not relate elements that should be
related if this were an actual ranking.</p>
<p>Just look at <span class="math inline">\(0 \mathrel{S} 1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(1 \mathrel{S} 2\)</span>. This tells us that
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is ranked higher than <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is ranked higher than <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span> (again, it doesn’t matter if we say
“ranked higher” or “ranked lower”). But in a normal ranking, this would
mean that <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is also ranked higher
than <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. Yet we do not have <span
class="math inline">\(0 \mathrel{S} 2\)</span>. According to <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> are completely unrelated,
contradicting our intuitions about how a ranking ought to work. In a
ranking, it is always the case that if <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> outranks something that outranks <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> outranks <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>For this reason, an ordered set has to use a binary relation that is
in some sense ranking-like. Among other things, this means that the
relation can’t contain loops or cycles, and it must not have gaps that
would be filled in if it were actually a ranking. If this seems awfully
fuzzy to you, just focus on the intuition for now and check out the
formal definitions in the next unit.</p>
<h2 id="linear-and-partial-orders">Linear and partial orders</h2>
<p>There are numerous types of orders, and the next unit covers them in
detail. For now, it suffices to be aware of the major split between
<strong>total orders</strong> and <strong>partial orders</strong>. Total
orders are also called <strong>linear orders</strong>, which conveys the
essential intuition behind them: a relation is a total order if it can
be represented by writing all elements in a single line. A partial order
is more flexible and allows some elements to be unordered with respect
to each other, as long as this does not violate our requirement that the
relation must be ranking-like.</p>
<p>Let’s consider once more the examples above. The relation <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> defines a total order over the set
of natural numbers as there are no two elements that are unordered with
respect to each other. No matter which two numbers <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> we look at, we either have <span
class="math inline">\(x \leq y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y
\leq x\)</span>. And if we have both <span class="math inline">\(x \leq
y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \leq x\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> must be the same number. So we can’t
have any odd situations like a loop from 10 back to 5. Hence we do
indeed end up with a single line. And if we have a single line, we have
a linear order, i.e a total order.</p>
<p>The relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, on the other
hand, only defines a partial order. While we do still have a rough order
between numbers based on their recursive digit sum, numbers with the
same digit sum are unordered with respect to each other. This can be
seen clearly in the corresponding figure. We are still dealing with some
kind of ranking, though, as all elements in the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-th column of the figure are ranked
higher than all the elements in the columns to their right. We still
have a ranking of sorts, there’s just a lot elements that occupy the
same rank.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<ul>
<li>Binary relations can be used to induce an order over a set, yielding
an <strong>ordered set</strong> (e.g. the natural numbers with <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>).</li>
<li>Orders must be ranking-like. They cannot contain any loops or
cycles, and it must the case that if <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> outranks something that outranks <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> outranks <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</li>
<li>The order is <strong>total</strong> (or <strong>linear</strong>) iff
all elements of the set are related to each other. Intuitively, total
orders build lines.</li>
<li>Partial orders allow some elements to be unordered with respect to
each other. Intuitively, they cannot be represented by a single line and
instead require more complex arrangements.</li>
