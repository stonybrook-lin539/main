# Vectors

For now, you can just think of vectors as tuples written a different way.
Instead of the tuple $\tuple{a,b,c}$, one could write the **column vector**

$$\begin{pmatrix} a\\b\\c\\ \end{pmatrix}$$

or the **row vector**

$$\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c\\ \end{pmatrix}$$

Row vectors may also be written with commas between their elements, e.g. $(a, b, c)$, at which point they really look just like tuples but with parentheses instead of pointy brackets.

::: exercise
Rewrite each one of the following as instructed

- $\tuple{10, 7, 5, -2.3}$ as a column vector
- $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ as a tuple
- $\tuple{\mathrm{True}, \mathrm{False}}$ as a row vector
- $\tuple{0}$ as a column vector

Once I have more time to expand this unit, you'll learn a bit more about the intuition behind vectors.
