# Factorial (Solutions)

::: exercise
Write down all possible ways of ordering $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ and confirm that this number is the same as $4!$.

::: solution
There are 24 distinct way of ordering $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.

1. abcd
1. abdc
1. acbd
1. acdb
1. adbc
1. adcb
1. bacd
1. badc
1. bcad
1. bcda
1. bdac
1. bdca
1. cabd
1. cadb
1. cbad
1. cbda
1. cdab
1. cdba
1. dabc
1. dacb
1. dbac
1. dbca
1. dcab
1. dcba

This is the same as $4! = 4 \mult 3! = 4 \mult 3 \mult 2! = 4 \mult 3 \mult 2 \mult 1! = 4 \mult 3 \mult 2 \mult 1 = 24$.
