# Notation: Big operators

Very often, a formula requires you to combine a fixed collection of elements in a specific manner.
For example, we may have a set of natural numbers $S \is \setof{10, 35, 100, 275, 1000, 8883}$ and want to combine them with some specific operation, say, $\oplus$.
It does not matter what this operation does; the symbol $\oplus$ has no standardized meaning in mathematics, it could be addition, multiplication, string concatentation, or a completely new operation that you just defined yourself --- $\oplus$ could be literally anything.
The only thing that matters here is that we want to write an expression to show that we are combining all elements of $S$ via $\oplus$.

Of course we could write out a formula like $10 \oplus 35 \oplus 100 \oplus 275 \oplus 1000 \oplus 8883$.
But this has two downsides:

1. It is tedious for small sets and infeasible for large ones.
1. It presumes that we know the members of the set.

A more elegant solution is to use an indexed operator:

$$
\bigoplus_{n \in S} n
$$

An indexed operator has a subscripted condition that contains a variable (here $n$) and a specification of what value $n$ can assume.
In the example above, all instantiations of $n$ must be members of $S$.
One then instantiates all possible values of $n$ and combines them with the operation defined by the operator.

This may still sound awfully abstract, but a few concrete examples will clarify things.

## $\sum$: sum/addition

The most common operator is the sum operator $\sum$, which indicates addition (get it? **s**igma, **s**um).
The elements to be summed are commonly drawn from a set or an interval.

::: example
$$
\sum_{n \in \setof{2,5,8,10}} n
= 2 + 5 + 8 + 10 = 25
$$

Note that it does not matter in which order we substitute values for $n$.

$$
\sum_{n \in \setof{2,5,8,10}} n
= 8 + 5 + 10 + 2 = 25
$$
:::

::: example
$$
\sum_{1 \leq n \leq 10} n
=
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10
=
55
$$
:::

::: exercise
Write each one of the following expressions as a formula with the addition operator $+$.

$$
5 - \sum_{1 \leq i \leq 3} i
$$

$$
\sum_{i = 1} i + i + i
$$

::: solution
$$
5 - \sum_{1 \leq i \leq 3} i = 5 - (1+2+3) = 5-6 =-1
$$

$$
\sum_{i = 1} i + i + i = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
$$

::: exercise
Express each formula below in a more succinct format using the sum operator $\sum$.

- $20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 + 28 + 29$
- $2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10$
- $30 + 15 + 3 + 10 + 2 + 20$
- $-10 - 9 - 8 - 7$

::: solution
- $$ 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 + 28 + 20 = \sum_{20 \leq i \leq 29} i$$
- $$2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = \sum_{1\leq i \leq 5} 2i $$
- $$30 + 15 + 3 + 10 + 2 + 20 = \sum_{n \in \setof{2,3,10,15,20,30}}n$$
- $$-10 - 9 - 8 - 7 = -\sum_{7\leq i \leq 10}n$$
:::
:::

Sometimes, $\sum$ is used with a format where the subscript indicates the lowest of a range of values and a superscript specifies the cutoff point.

::: example
$$
\sum_{n=-5}^7
=
-5 + -4 + -3 + -2 + -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7
=
13
$$
:::

::: exercise
Rewrite the formula below so that it uses the subscript/superscript format.

$$
5 - \sum_{1 \leq i \leq 3} i
$$

:::solution
$$
5 - \sum_{1 \leq i \leq 3} i = 5 - \sum_{i=1}^3 i
$$
:::
:::

The variable need not always occur by itself, it can be part of a larger expression.

::: example
$$
\sum_{n = 1}^{3} 2 \mult (n + 3)
=
2 \mult (1 + 3) + 2 \mult (2 + 3) + 2 \mult (3 + 3)
=
8 + 10 + 18
=
36
$$

Of course we could have also written this as follows:

$$
\sum_{n \in \setof{8, 10, 18}}
$$

But this formula is just an idiosyncratic summation of three seemingly random numbers, whereas $\sum_{n = 1}^{3} 2 \mult (n + 3)$ captures a specific kind of systematicity.
And this expression readily generalizes to values for $n$ that are strictly greater than $3$, which is not the case for the completely idiosyncratic $\sum_{n \in \setof{8, 10, 18}}$. 
:::

::: exercise
Consider once more the formulas below.

- $20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 + 28 + 29$
- $2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10$
- $30 + 15 + 3 + 10 + 2 + 20$
- $-10 - 9 - 8 - 7$

Combine the sum operator with other operations in order to describe each formula in a more systematic way. 
Keep in mind that there are infinitely many ways this can be done, just pick the one that seems most plausible to you.

::: solution
- $$20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 + 28 + 29 = 20 +\sum_{0 \leq i \leq 9} i$$
- $$2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 2 \sum_{n \in \setof{1,2...10} | n is an even number}$$
- $30 + 15 + 3 + 10 + 2 + 20$
- $$-10 - 9 - 8 - 7 = \sum_{n = 0}^3 (n-10)$$
:::
:::

Quite generally, $\sum$ can occur wherever addition may occur, so we can build some very complex formulas with this operator.
We can even have multiple instances of $\sum$ in the same expression. 

::: example
\begin{align*}
  & \log_2 \left ( \left (\sum_{0 \leq i \leq 5} 2^i \right ) - 2 \mult \sum_{j \in \setof{3,5,7,9}} \frac{j}{2} \right )\\
= & \log_2 \left ( \left(2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 \right) - 2 \mult \left (\frac{3}{2} + \frac{5}{2} + \frac{7}{2} + \frac{9}{2} \right ) \right )\\
= & \log_2 ( 63 - 2 \mult 12)\\
= & \log_2  (63 - 24)\\
= & \log_2 39\\
\approx & 5.285\\
\end{align*}
:::

In fact, when we have multiple operators of this kind, variables of one can be dependent on the variables of another.

::: example
\begin{align*}
& \sum_{i=1}^{3} \sum_{j=0}^{i} i^j\\
= & \sum_{j=0}^{1} 1^j + \sum_{j=0}^{2} 2^j + \sum_{j=0}^{3} 3^j\\
= & 1^0 + 2^0 + 2^1 + 3^0 + 3^1 + 3^2\\
= & 17
\end{align*}
:::

When $\sum$ occurs as part of a larger expression, correct bracketing becomes very important.
The scope of the sum operator extends rightward to its variable, but no further than that.
Hence we have to use brackets to indicate parts that should be part of each summing step.

::: example
The two expressions below only differ in their bracketing and yield different results.

$$
\sum_{n = 1}^{4} n + 5
= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
= 15
$$

$$
\sum_{n = 1}^{4} (n + 5)
= (1 + 5) + (2 + 5) + (3 + 5) + (4 + 5)
= 35
$$

The first expression could also be written as follows:

$$
5 + \sum{n = 1}^{4}
$$
:::

Finally, take care not to confuse the operator $\sum$ with the common alphabet symbol $\Sigma$.
Sometimes both can show up in one and the same formula.

::: example
Here is an example of a definition that mixes the sum operator $\sum$ with the alphabet symbol $\Sigma$:

Suppose that for some reason we need to define a new notion \emph{ID-number} for alphabets that only contain natural numbers.
Given such an alphabet $\Sigma$, its ID-number is

$$
\sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma} \sigma
$$

So if $\Sigma \is \setof{2,7,201}$, then its ID-number is

$$
\sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma} \sigma = 2 + 7 + 201 = 210.
$$
:::


## $\prod$: product/multiplication

The operator $\prod$ works exactly like $\sum$, except that it denotes multiplication (so the letter **p**i is used for the **p**roduct operation).

::: example
$$
\prod_{n \in \setof{2,5,8,10}} n
= 2 \mult 5 \mult 8 \mult 10 = 800
$$
:::

::: example
$$
\prod_{1 \leq n \leq 10} n
=
1 \mult 2 \mult 3 \mult 4 \mult 5 \mult 6 \mult 7 \mult 8 \mult 9 \mult 10
=
3,628,800
$$
:::

::: example
$$
\prod_{n=-5}^7
=
-5 \mult -4 \mult -3 \mult -2 \mult -1 \mult 0 \mult 1 \mult 2 \mult 3 \mult 4 \mult 5 \mult 6 \mult 7
=
0
$$
:::

::: example
$$
\prod_{n = 1}^{3} 2 - (n \mult 3)
=
(2 - (1 \mult 3)) \mult (2 - (2 \mult 3)) \mult (2 - (3 \mult 3))
=
-1 \mult -4 \mult -7
=
-28
$$
:::

Just like $\sum$, $\prod$ can occur as part of a larger formula with other operators.

::: example
\begin{align*}
& \prod_{i=1}^{3} \prod_{j=0}^{i} i^j\\
= & \prod_{j=0}^{1} 1^j \mult \prod_{j=0}^{2} 2^j \mult \prod_{j=0}^{3} 3^j\\
= & 1^0 \mult 1^1 \mult 2^0 \mult 2^1 \mult 2^2 \mult 3^0 \mult 3^1 \mult 3^2 \mult 3^3\\
= & 5832
\end{align*}
:::

## Other examples

Many binary operators have big counterparts.
This includes $\cap$ and $\cup$ in set theory, $\wedge$ and $\vee$ in logic, and non-descript operations like $\oplus$ and $\otimes$ in abstract algebra.

::: example
$$
\bigcup_{ S \in \setof{ \setof{0, 1, \ldots, n} \mid  3 \leq n \leq 5}} S
=
\setof{0,1,2,3} \cup \setof{0,1,2,3,4} \cup \setof{0,1,2,3,4,5}
=
\setof{0,1,2,3,4,5}
$$
:::

::: example
\begin{multline*}
\bigwedge_{n \in \setof{2,3,4}} \neg \text{has-$n$-daughters}(x) =\\
\neg \text{has-2-daughters}(x)
\wedge
\neg \text{has-3-daughters}(x)
\wedge
\neg \text{has-4-daughters}(x)
\end{multline*}
:::

And as before, all these operators can be nested or appear in sequence.

::: example
Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a finite set of sets of natural numbers.
More precisely, $\mathcal{S} \is \setof{ \setof{0,3,6}, \setof{2,3,9}, \setof{2,9}}$.
Then

$$
\prod_{S \in \mathcal{S}} \sum_{n \in S} n
=
\sum_{n \in \setof{0, 3, 6}} n
\mult
\sum_{n \in \setof{2, 3, 9}} n
\mult
\sum_{n \in \setof{2,9}} n
=
(0 + 3 + 6)
\mult
(2 + 3 + 9)
\mult
(2 + 9)
=
1386
$$
:::

::: exercise
Suppose that $\mathcal{S} \is \setof{ \setof{0,3,6}, \setof{2,3,9}, \setof{2,9}}$ as before.
What is the value of the formula below, assuming that $i \oplus j = ij$ if $i \geq j$ and $ji$ otherwise
(for example, $8 \oplus 7 = 87$ and $3 \oplus 15 = 153$).

$$
\prod_{S \in \mathcal{S}} \bigoplus_{n \in S} n
$$

::: solution
Assume $i \oplus j \oplus k$ follows a leftwards operation order, i.e.,$i \oplus j \oplus k = ij \oplus k$ if $i \geq j$, and $ij \oplus k = kij $ if $k \geq ij$), then we have:
$$
\prod_{S \in \mathcal{S}} \bigoplus_{n \in S} n = 

\bigoplus_{n \in \setof{0, 3, 6}} n
\mult
\bigoplus_{n \in \setof{2, 3, 9}} n
\mult
\bigoplus_{n \in \setof{2,9}} n
=
( 0 \oplus 3 \oplus 6) 
\mult
( 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 9)
\mult
( 2 \oplus 9)
=
306
\mult
329
\mult
92
=
9262008
$$

## Two important requirements

There are two important restrictions on the use of these operators.
First, they are only guaranteed to give a well-defined result if there are only finitely many substitutions for all variables.

::: example
Without further stipulations, the following formula has no well-defined result:

$$
\sum_{n > 0} n
=
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ...
=
???
$$
:::

Second, the operation must be associative and commutative.
Associativity means that the order of evaluation does not matter, whereas commutativity ensures that the operation does not care about the order of arguments.
Together, these two properties guarantee that the result does not change depending on the order in which variables are replaced by values.

::: example
Subtraction is neither associative nor commutative: $(5 - 2) - 3 \neq 5 - (2 -3)$, and $5 - 2 \neq 2 - 5$.
So there is no big operator version of subtraction because the results would depend on how variables are instantiated.
For instance, $-_{n \in \setof{5,2}} n$ could yield $5 - 2$ or $2 - 5$, which have very different results.

Even if we agreed on a convention for this, e.g. always substituting larger values before smaller ones, the resulting formula would still be ambiguous because subtraction is not associative.
Contrast the following two:

$$
-_{n \in \setof{5,3,2}} n = (5 - 3) - 2 = 0
$$

$$
-_{n \in \setof{5,3,2}} n = 5 - (3 - 2) = 4
$$
