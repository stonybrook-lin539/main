# What's to come, and what you should know already

:::prereqs
- functions(basics, function growth, domain and co-domain)
- sets(basic notation, operations, cardinality)
- strings(basic notation, parts of strings)

This chapter takes a deep dive into monotonicity and the role it seems to play in natural language.
We will look at a wide range of phenomena in morphology (word structure), syntax (sentence structure), and morphosyntax (how sentence structure interacts with word structure).
Among other things, we will discuss the influential \*ABA generalization, the distribution of negative polarity items like *ever*, the typology of Person Case constraints (PCCs), and the phenomenon of adjunct island effects.
As part of that discussion, we will encounter several new mathematical concepts:

- relations as a generalization of functions,
- tuples like $\tuple{1,2,1}$, which in contrast to sets are ordered and may contain multiple instances of the same element,
- linear orders and partial orders,
- semilattices and lattices.

Before you proceed, you should make sure that you are on top of the mathematical prerequisites listed at the beginning of this unit as these will be presupposed throughout this chapter without being explicitly listed as prerequisites at the top of each unit.
