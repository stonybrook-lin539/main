# Supplementary readings, or: What's unique about this book?

This book is far from the only game in town when it comes to mathematics and linguistics, and that's a good thing.
It is impossible for a single resource to please everyone.
Some readers may want more mathematical rigor, others want to focus on the intuitions.
Some want a comprehensive tome, others a slim pamphlet.
When I set out to write this book, I wanted to create something that provides a new route into mathematical linguistics, something that works for those readers who bounced off the existing resources for whatever reason.
So let's take a look at what's already out there and how this book differs from that.

## Partee et al (1993): Mathematical Methods in Linguistics (Second edition)

This is arguably the best-known introduction to mathematical approaches to linguistics.
It was a remarkable achievements at its time, and depending on your interests it may still be the best book for you.
At almost 700 pages, *Mathematical Methods in Linguistics* is very comprehensive and covers many topics at greater length than my book.
For example, I cover sets in a few short background units, whereas *Mathematical Methods in Linguistics* devotes its entire first chapter to sets.
So if you feel like the treatment of some mathematical concept is too abridged in my book, you might find a more satisfactory treatment in Partee et al (1990).

The downside is that linguistic applications are mostly limited to semantics, the study of meaning.
The focus on semantics greatly shapes what mathematical topics are covered, and hence you won't find things like vectors or matrix multiplication that are becoming increasingly important in linguistics.
Where the book ventures beyond semantics, e.g. in its chapters on automata theory, it fails to make a compelling case for their relevance to language.
In a way, my book is the very opposite of Partee et al's in that I talk about pretty much everything except semantics.
Overall *Mathematical Methods in Linguistics* is still an excellent read, but it should probably be called *Mathematics for Semanticists*.

## Gamut (1990): Logic, Language, and Meaning (Volumes 1 & 2)

This one already tells you in the title that it will be heavy on logic and meaning, i.e. semantics.
I prefer its treatment of formal logic to that in other textbooks, and it includes less common topics such as many-valued logic.
But as with Partee et al's *Mathematical Methods in Linguistics*, the exclusive focus on logic and semantics means that readers won't get to see most of the ways mathematics can be applied to language.

## Keenan & Moss (2016): Mathematical Structures in Languages

This is a much thinner book than *Mathematical Methods in Linguistics*, and it does quite a few things to set itself apart.
While the second half of the book is still heavily focused on semantics, the first half does branch out and also talks about things such as feature systems in phonology (the grammar of sounds).
Most importantly, perhaps, this book has a heavy emphasis on mathematical proofs.
If you are aspiring mathematical linguist, proofs will be essential in your research, and *Mathematical Structures in Languages* is a good place to learn the basics of constructing mathematical proofs.
But if you just want to learn some hand-on techniques for modeling language in an insightful manner, the abundance of proofs may prove distracting (yes, the pun is as lame as it is intended).
By contrast, I largely omit mathematical proofs in this book, including just enough of them to illustrate what a mathematical proof is and why it is insightful and extremely powerful.
The emphasis is on the hands-on application of mathematical insights rather than the creation of new mathematical insights.
If you find that too limiting and want to dive into constructing your own proofs, check out *Mathematical Structures in Languages*.

## Kornai (2008): Mathematical Linguistics

This is a very different kind of textbook as it targets mathematically minded readers with no prior training in linguistics --- in particular mathematicians and computer scientists.
As a result, the book covers a very different range of topics than the textbooks listed above, including information theory, speech processing, and handwriting recognition, among others.
This makes for a very unique contribution, but also one that is a highly acquired taste.
Linguistically-minded reader may find the choice of topics dry or boring, shying away from the phenomena and issues that make linguistics exciting.
And readers without any linguistic training may still find it hard to follow the linguistic parts of the book.
Overall, it is still a worthwhile read with many things you can't find anywhere else.
Just make sure it isn't your first read on mathematics or linguistics (good thing you're currently reading a book that does work just fine as a first read).

## Kracht (2003): The Mathematics of Language

I consider this is the best book on this list, but it is also the least read and/or understood.
If you are an advanced reader with lots of mathematical maturity and an excellent command of linguistics, Kracht's *Mathematics of Language* is a dream come true, a treasure trove of definitions, theorems and proofs.
If you are on your way to to becoming a researcher in mathematical linguistics, it will be one of the most enjoyable reads of your life.
If you're none of the above, this is a 600 page paperweight.
The book will simply be impenetrable to you, and that is a shame because it has so many important things to tell you.
Hopefully, after reading my book and one of the others listed above, you will be ready to take on Kracht's magnum opus.
It will still be very challenging, but you should have a decent chance of survival.
