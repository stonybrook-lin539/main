## General intros

1. [Partee, ter Meulen, Wall *Mathematical Methods in Linguistics*](https://smile.amazon.com/Mathematical-Methods-Linguistics-Studies-Philosophy/dp/9027722447/) is the oldest textbook on mathematics for linguist and still does a decent job.
   However, it is heavily focused on mathematics for semantics, i.e. the study of meaning, and the last part on formal language theory (e.g. finite state automata) isn't all that good.
1. I am very fond of [Keenan & Moss *Mathematical Structures in Languages*](https://smile.amazon.com/Mathematical-Structures-Languages-Lecture-Notes/dp/1575868725/) as I was Keenan's TA for the course that led to this textbook.
   It is also focused on semantics, in particular quantifiers, and also covers some more abstract concepts from algebra such as automorphism groups.
   If you don't want that stuff, I still recommend the first few chapters as an alternative take on a lot of the material we covered in class.
1. [Volume 1](https://smile.amazon.com/Logic-Language-Meaning-Introduction/dp/0226280853) and [Volume 2](https://smile.amazon.com/Logic-Language-Meaning-Intensional-Logical/dp/0226280888/) of Gamut's *Logic, Language, and Meaning* provide a wonderful introduction to logic for linguistics.

## Lambda Calculus

1. [Barendregt *The Lambda Calculus*](https://smile.amazon.com/Calculus-Semantics-Studies-Foundations-Mathematics/dp/0444875085) is a classic on the mathematics of the untyped lambda calculus.

1. [Carpenter *Type-Logical Semantics*](https://smile.amazon.com/Type-Logical-Semantics-Language-Speech-Communication/dp/0262032481) covers the typed lambda calculus from a linguistic perspective.

## Monoids and semirings

We didn't get to this, and the material will be permanently moved out of this class into our graduate statistics/probabilistic methods course.
If you'd like to do a bit of self-study, here's two papers that cover applications of semirings in linguistics.

1. Riggle, Jason (2009): Violation Semirings in Optimality Theory. *Research on Language and Computation* 7, Article 1. <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11168-009-9063-0>
1. Goodman, Joshua (1999): Semiring Parsing. *Computational Linguistics* 25, 573--605. <http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/J99-4004>

## Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG)

On the skill survey, but not covered in class, again because we didn't have enough time left to fully explore applications of logic in linguistics.

1. Steedman, Mark (2019): [Combinatory Categorial Grammar](https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/53736/10.1515_9783110540253-014.pdf?sequence=1). In András Kertész, Edith Moravcsik, and Csilla Rákosi [eds.], *Current Approaches to Syntax*, 389--420. Mouton de Gruyter: Berlin.
