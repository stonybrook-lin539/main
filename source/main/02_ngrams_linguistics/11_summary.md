# Summary of n-grams in linguistics

This unit introduced $n$-grams as a fundamental concepts of computational and theoretical linguistics alike.

- A negative $n$-gram grammar is a set of $n$-grams.
    - A string is well-formed iff it does not contain any forbidden $n$-grams.
    - An $n$-gram grammar is fixed if all $n$-grams have the same length, and mixed otherwise.
- Every negative $n$-gram grammar has an equivalent positive $n$-gram grammar, and the other way round.
- Positive grammars must be fixed, the length of $n$-grams cannot vary.
- The maximum size of an $n$-gram grammar grows polynomially with the size of the alphabet, and exponentially with the value of $n$.
- Multiple grammars can be combined into a single grammar.
    - Negative grammars: union of sets
    - Positive grammars: intersection of sets
- Whereas an $n$-gram grammar is a set, a bag-of-words model is a multiset.
    - The multiset counts for each word type its number of word tokens.
    - Multiset sum and scalar multiplication can be used to combine and modify counts.
- Due to Zipf's law, a small number of words make up the majority of each text.
  Very frequent words that contribute little information are called stop words.
- The function $\mathrm{del}_S$ removes all stop words.
- Mathematically, this is the same as constructing phonological tiers.
- Tiers make it possible to handle long-distance dependencies in an elegant fashion with much smaller grammars.

## Some additional terminology

We now have two types of $n$-gram grammars: those that regulate strings, and those that regulate tiers.
The former are commonly referred to as **strictly local** (SL) grammars, whereas the latter are **tier-based strictly local** (TSL).
A TSL grammar consists of both an SL grammar $G$ and a set $T$ of tier symbols.
A string $s$ is well-formed with respect to the TSL grammar iff $\mathrm{del}_{^+T}(s)$ is well-formed with respect to $G$.

By default SL and TSL grammars are negative, but positive counterparts can be defined as usual.


# Extra exercises on n-grams

::: exercise
Write a negative grammar $G_1$ with alphabet $\setof{a,b,c}$ such that $L(G)$ contains all strings that start and end with an $a$.
Then write a another grammar $G_2$ over the same alphabet that only generates strings where each $a$ is immediately followed by a $b$.
After that, write another grammar $G_3$ over the same alphabet that requires $b$ to only occur in clusters of the form $bba$.
So a string like *aaaabbaaabba* is well-formed, but *aaaaba* or *bb* is not.
Finally, construct a combined grammar $G_{1,2,3}$.
What is the language generated by this grammar?

::: exercise
Continuing the previous exercise, fill in the cells in the table below with Y or N depending on whether the grammar generates the string.
The first row has already been completed as an example.

|          | $G_1$ | $G_2$ | $G_3$ | $G_{1,2,3}$ |
| --:      | :-:   | :-:   | :-:   | :-:         |
| *a*      | Y     | N     | Y     | N           |
| *b*      |       |       |       |             |
| *aab*    |       |       |       |             |
| *aabba*  |       |       |       |             |
| *abbba*  |       |       |       |             |
| *aaaaaa* |       |       |       |             |
| *aabbab* |       |       |       |             |
