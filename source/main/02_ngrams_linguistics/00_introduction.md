# What's to come, and what you should know already

This chapter presents a very simple model of a very simple domain of language: **phonotactics**.
Phonotactics refers to the rules and laws that determine in what order sounds may occur in a word.
We will model phonotactics using some very simple machinery built on top of **n-grams**.
The simplicity of the model will allow us to study its behavior with mathematical methods.
While some of the results we learn in the process will be fairly mundane, others will be surprising.

The core insight of this chapter is that mathematics can teach us things about language by providing a deeper understanding of a linguistic model of language.
The model serves as the intermediary that connects mathematics and language.
In later chapters, we will apply mathematics directly to empirical data.
Both are common and highly insightful ways of using mathematics in the study of language.
