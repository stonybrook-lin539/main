::: exercise
Write a negative grammar $G_1$ with alphabet $\setof{a,b,c}$ such that $L(G)$ contains all strings that start and end with an $a$.
Then write a another grammar $G_2$ over the same alphabet that only generates strings where each $a$ is immediately followed by a $b$.
After that, write another grammar $G_3$ over the same alphabet that requires $b$ to only occur in clusters of the form $bba$.
So a string like *aaaabbaaabba* is well-formed, but *aaaaba* or *bb* is not.
Finally, construct a combined grammar $G_{1,2,3}$.
What is the language generated by this grammar?

::: exercise
Continuing the previous exercise, fill in the cells in the table below with Y or N depending on whether the grammar generates the string.
The first row has already been completed as an example.
