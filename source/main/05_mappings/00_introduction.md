# What's to come, and what you should know already

:::prereqs
- functions(basics, function growth, domain and co-domain)
- posets(basics, bounds, lattices)
- relations(basic notation, partial orders, linear orders)
- sets(basic notation, operations, cardinality, comparing)
- strings(basic notation, parts of strings)
- tuples(basics)
:::

This chapter will look at mappings from underlying representations to surface forms.
We will start out with string-to-string mappings in phonology (sound structure), but we will also consider tree-to-tree mappings in syntax (sentence structure).
This will be hashed out in formal terms with finite-state transducers and logical transductions, and as part of that we will encounter yet another batch of mathematical concepts:

- closure properties,
- propositional logic and first-order logic,
- for the daring: quotient structures.

Before you proceed, you should make sure that you are on top of the mathematical prerequisites listed at the beginning of this unit as these will be presupposed throughout this chapter without being explicitly listed as prerequisites at the top of each unit.
