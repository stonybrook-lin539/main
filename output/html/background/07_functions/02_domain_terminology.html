</div>
<p>Every function has a <strong>domain</strong> and a
<strong>co-domain</strong>. The domain is the set of objects from which
its arguments can be drawn, and the <strong>co-domain</strong> is the
set of objects from which outputs can be drawn.</p>
<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>
<p>One commonly writes <span class="math inline">\(f: D \rightarrow
C\)</span> to indicate that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a
function from domain <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> to co-domain
<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. A function is always undefined
on all arguments that do not belong to its domain.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x
+1\)</span>. This actually represents multiple functions depending on
how one picks the domain and co-domain.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow
\mathbb{N}\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a
function from natural numbers (0, 1, 2, ) to natural numbers. In this
case we have, among others, <span class="math inline">\(f(0) =
1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(500) = 501\)</span>.
However, <span class="math inline">\(f(-1)\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(f(2.5)\)</span> would be undefined because <span
class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(2.5\)</span> are not natural numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Now suppose that we have <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x +
1\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a
function from real numbers to real numbers. The set of real numbers,
denoted <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, includes every
number you came across in high school, e.g. <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(1.38702\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(-\frac{5}{17}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, and so on. Since the domain and
co-domain of this version of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> are
a lot larger, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is defined on a lot
more values and we have <span class="math inline">\(f(-1) = 0\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(f(2.5) = 3.5\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is still defined
by <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x + 1\)</span>, but we have <span
class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\)</span>. For
each one of the following, say whether it is defined or undefined.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(f(0)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f(-1)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f(-2)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(f(2.5)\)</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>When a car wash is viewed as a function, its domain is the set of all
cars (both dirty and clean), whereas the co-domain only contains clean
cars (again, in an ideal world where there’s no such think as broken car
washes).</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>What would be the domain and co-domain of a broken car wash that
fails to remove even the tiniest speck of dirt?</p>
</div>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that the domain and co-domain do not
need to provide a perfect fit. Not every element in the domain may
actually be mapped to some element of the co-domain, and not every
element of the co-domain may be an output for some input.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the function <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{N}
\rightarrow \mathbb{N}\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) = 2x - 1\)</span>. Even though <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is a natural number and hence in the
domain of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(f(0)\)</span> is undefined because <span
class="math inline">\(f(0) = 2 \times 0 - 1 = -1\)</span> is not a
natural number and hence not in the co-domain of <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. But there are also many natural
numbers in the co-domain that can never be the output of <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, e.g. <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Explain why there is no natural number <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> from the example above maps <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="total-and-partial-functions">Total and partial functions</h2>
<p>In the example above, the function <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is <strong>partial</strong> because it
is not defined on all values of the domain. A <strong>total</strong>
function, on the other hand, maps every element of its domain to some
element of its co-domain. Fields differ in whether they take total or
partial functions to be the default. For example, computer scientists
usually assume total functions and explicitly mention it when a function
is partial, whereas it is common in calculus to assume partial functions
and explicitly mention it when a function is total. Of course every
partial function can be made total by giving a tighter definition of its
domain, but this is not always practical. Sometimes the function is so
complex that one simply cannot say what elements it is defined on, and
hence one can only approximate its domain.</p>
<p>Quite generally, it is a matter of taste how tightly one wants to
define the domain and co-domain. A loose definition tells the reader
very little about what gets mapped to what by the function, but a
definition with a very tight fit, if it can be found at all, makes
things difficult to read. Nonetheless, the domain and co-domain are a
crucial part of a function’s definition, and this is why they are
usually specified before the precise mapping from inputs to outputs is
even given.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Here is an example of what this may look like: Let <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> be the set of English first names. Then
the function <span class="math inline">\(f: E \rightarrow \left \{ 0,1
\right \}\)</span> maps <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> contains at least three syllables.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="the-mapsto-notation">The <span
class="math inline">\(\mapsto\)</span> notation</h2>
<p>Irrespective of how one defines the domain and co-domain, and
irrespective of whether a function is total or partial, the mapping from
arguments to outputs can be defined in various ways, e.g. in plain
English, or as a formula like <span class="math inline">\(f(x) =
\frac{(x + x^2 + 5)^{x+1}}{1000^x}\)</span>. For very simple functions
whose name was already mentioned, one often writes <span
class="math inline">\(x \mapsto y\)</span> instead of <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) = y\)</span>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Instead of <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 5 \times x -
3\)</span>, we may simply write <span class="math inline">\(x \mapsto 5
\times x - 3\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The same notation can be used to indicate <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> for specific choices of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Instead of <span class="math inline">\(f(2) = 7\)</span>, we may
simply write <span class="math inline">\(2 \mapsto 7\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> Notice the difference between <span
class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mapsto\)</span>. The first is used when
specifying the domain and co-domain, whereas the latter indicates the
concrete mapping from an argument to an output.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<ul>
<li>The behavior of a function depends greatly on its
<strong>domain</strong> and <strong>co-domain</strong>. The domain
specifies the set that inputs can be drawn from, and the co-domain is
the set that outputs can be drawn from.</li>
<li>The standard notation is <em>function name: domain <span
class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> co-domain</em>, e.g. <span
class="math inline">\(f: \Sigma^* \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\)</span>.</li>
<li>A function is <strong>total</strong> if it is defined for all
elements of its domain. Otherwise it is <strong>partial</strong>.</li>
<li>When the function we are defining is already clear from context, we
may write <span class="math inline">\(x \mapsto y\)</span> instead of
<span class="math inline">\(f(x) = y\)</span>. For example, <span
class="math inline">\(x \mapsto 2^x - 5\)</span> is an alternative to
<span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 2^x - 5\)</span>.</li>
