<p>Caution: <span class="math inline">\(\{\)</span> and <span

<div class="solution_explained">
<ol type="1">
<li>The symbols <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> are distinct (and so are <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>). Hence <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{abba}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{ABBA}\)</span> already contain different
symbols in their very first position, and consequently the strings are
distinct.</li>
<li>While it is true that the sum of <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(10\)</span>, the exercise asks you to compare the
string <span class="math inline">\(5 + 5\)</span> to the string <span
class="math inline">\(10\)</span>. These are very different strings. For
example, only the former contains the symbol <span
class="math inline">\(+\)</span>, and only the letter contains <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</li>
<li>This one is tricky. If we were talking about sets, then it would be
the case <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ m,a,d \right \}\)</span>
is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ d,a,m \right
\}\)</span> because sets are unordered. But here you are asked to
consider strings, not sets. These strings just so happen to start with
<span class="math inline">\(\{\)</span> and end with <span
class="math inline">\(\}\)</span>, but they are still strings. And since
the second symbol of the left string is <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, whereas the right string has <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> in its second position, these two
strings are distinct.</li>

<p>For each one of the following, say whether it is a valid alphabet.
Justify your answer.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 0,1 \right \}\)</span></li>
<li>the set of all English words that are spelled with at most 5
characters</li>
<li>all natural numbers less than 1000</li>
<li>the nucleobases of DNA: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine</li>
</ul>
<div class="solution">
<p>An alphabet must be a finite set of symbols. Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \}\)</span> is valid
because it contains exactly one symbol and thus is finite</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 0,1 \right \}\)</span> is valid
because it contains exactly two symbols and thus is finite</li>
<li>The set of all English words that are spelled with at most 5
characters is also a finite set: The English alphabet has 26 letters,
which means that there are at most <span class="math inline">\(26^5 =
11,881,376\)</span> words that fit these requirements. While that is a
large number, it is still finite. The fact that each symbol is itself a
string of characters does not matter, that is an artefact of our writing
system. If instead we had a unique symbol to refer to each one of these
words, e.g. pictograms, the issue wouldn’t even arise.</li>
<li>The set of all natural numbers less than 1000 is also a possible
alphabet because this set is finite. Again you might be concerned that
we write natural numbers as strings of digits and it may seem weird to
you to have symbols that are internally complex. But just like with the
English words, this is just an artefact of how we write numbers. In
hexademical notation, for instance, the natural number <span
class="math inline">\(11\)</span> would be a single symbol <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</li>
<li>The nucleobases of DNA once again form a finite set and hence are a
valid alphabet. Again these are symbols with internal structure, in this
case their molecular structure. When we treat the nucleobases as the
symbols of our alphabet, we are making a decision to ignore their
internal structure and treat them as the smallest unit of analysis (just
like, say, a phonologist may treat sounds as the smallest unit of
analysis and ignore the sound waves that actually give rise to the
sounds).</li>

that can be built over the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\left \{

never be two distinct strings of the same length. Hence we just start

<div class="solution">
<p>There are infinitely many solutions. For example, if <span

<p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(u \mathrel{\mathop:}=a\)</span>
