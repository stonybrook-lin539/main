<p>Disclaimer: This unit is different from other background units in
that it is quite opinionated. I will talk about the Kuratowski
definition of pairs and how linguists’ attempts to leverage it for the
study of sentence structure have serious problems. A lot of them stem
from a misunderstanding of the status of mathematical definitions and
their intended usage. After reading this unit, you will hopefully have a
deeper appreciation of these issues and stay away from such
misapplications of math.</p>
<h2 id="pairs-as-sets">Pairs as sets</h2>
<p>As you have seen several times by now, mathematics provides many
different ways of talking about the same thing. This includes the option
to look at pairs as specific kinds of sets. In fact, there are many
different ways of defining pairs as sets. Below is a
far-from-comprehensive selection of such definitions.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>We define the <strong>pair</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\left
\langle a,b \right \rangle\)</span> as the set</p>

</div>
<p>Note that since these are definitions, they cannot be true or false.
The only question is whether these are useful definitions of pairs. What
exactly this means depends on why one would want to use sets instead of
pairs. At the very least, though, a useful definition of pairs has to
preserve the most fundamental property of pairs: <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle a,b \right \rangle = \left \langle
c,d \right \rangle\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(a =
c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b = d\)</span>. Let us take a
closer look at whether that holds for the two Kuratowski
definitions.</p>
<h2 id="the-logic-behind-the-long-kuratowski-definition">The logic
behind the long Kuratowski definition</h2>
<p>According to the long Kuratowski definition, the pair <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle a,b \right \rangle\)</span> is
equivalent to the set <span class="math inline">\(\left \{  \left \{ a
\right \}, \left \{ a,b \right \}  \right \}\)</span>. The two are
equivalent because they satisfy the same identity condition: <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle a,b \right \rangle = \left \langle
c,d \right \rangle\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(a =
c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a = d\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{  \left \{ a \right \}, \left \{ a,b
\right \} \right \} = \left \{  \left \{ c \right \}, \left \{ c, d
\right \} \right \}\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(a =
c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b = d\)</span>. Let us verify
that this indeed holds.</p>
<div class="proof">
<p>The right to left direction is trivial: if <span
class="math inline">\(a = c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b =
d\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\left \{  \left \{ a \right
\}, \left \{ a,b \right \}  \right \} = \left \{  \left \{ c \right \},
\left \{ c,d \right \} \right \}\)</span>. In the other direction, we
have to consider two separate cases depending on whether <span
class="math inline">\(a = b\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(a
\neq b\)</span>. In each case, we need to show that <span
class="math inline">\(a = c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b =
d\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Case 1.</strong> Suppose <span class="math inline">\(a =
b\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(\{ \{a\}, \{a,b\} \} = \{
\{a\}, \{a, a\} \} = \{ \{a\}, \{a\} \} = \{ \{a\} \}\)</span>. But then
<span class="math inline">\(\{ \{a\}, \{a,b\} \} = \{ \{c\}, \{c,d\}
\}\)</span> is the same as <span class="math inline">\(\{ \{a\} \} = \{
\{c\}, \{c,d\} \}\)</span>. This is possible only if <span
class="math inline">\(\{ c \} = \{c ,d\}\)</span>, which implies <span
class="math inline">\(c = d\)</span>. Hence <span
class="math inline">\(\{ \{c\}, \{c,d\} \} = \{ \{c\}, \{c,c\} \} = \{
\{c\}, \{c\} \} = \{\{c\}\} = \{\{a\}\}\)</span>, which entails <span
class="math inline">\(a = c\)</span>. As we already know that <span
class="math inline">\(a = b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c =
d\)</span>, we also conclude from <span class="math inline">\(a =
c\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\(b = d\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Case 2.</strong> Now suppose that <span
class="math inline">\(a \neq b\)</span>. Then either <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \} = \left \{ c,d \right
\}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \} = \left
\{ c \right \}\)</span>. We consider each subcase.</p>
<p><strong>Subcase 2.1.</strong> Suppose towards a contradiction that
<span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \} = \left \{ c,d \right
\}\)</span>. Since two sets with distinct cardinality cannot be
identical, the equality <span class="math inline">\(\{a\} =
\{c,d\}\)</span> holds only if <span class="math inline">\(c =
d\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(\{ \{a\}, \{a,b\} \} = \{
\{c\}, \{c,d\} \} = \{ \{c\}, \{c\} \}\)</span>. But then we have both
<span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \} = \left \{ c \right
\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b \right \} =
\left \{ c \right \}\)</span>. This is impossible unless <span
class="math inline">\(a = b\)</span>, but by our initial assumption for
Case 2, <span class="math inline">\(a \neq b\)</span>. This is a
contradiction, disproving the assumption of Subcase 2.1 that <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \} = \left \{ c,d \right
\}\)</span>. We conclude that <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a
\right \} \neq \left \{ c,d \right \}\)</span> after all.</p>
<p><strong>Subcase 2.2.</strong> Assume, then, that <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \} = \left \{ c \right \} \neq
\left \{ c,d \right \}\)</span>. This implies that <span
class="math inline">\(a = c\)</span>, so it only remains for us to show
that <span class="math inline">\(b = d\)</span>. Note that <span
class="math inline">\(c \neq d\)</span> because we assume <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ c \right \} \neq \left \{ c,d \right
\}\)</span>. Given all these (in)equalities, <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{  \left \{ a \right \}, \left \{ a,b
\right \}  \right \} = \left \{  \left \{ c \right \}, \left \{ c,d
\right \}  \right \}\)</span> necessarily entails that <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b \right \} = \left \{ c,d \right
\}\)</span>, which in turn implies <span class="math inline">\(b =
d\)</span> because we already know that <span class="math inline">\(a =
c\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a \neq b\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Show that the Wiener definition of pairs preserves identity. That is
to say, prove that <span class="math inline">\(\left \{  \left \{  \left
\{ a \right \}, \emptyset  \right \}, \left \{  \left \{ b \right
\}  \right \}  \right \} = \left \{  \left \{  \left \{ c \right \},
\emptyset  \right \}, \left \{  \left \{ d \right \}  \right \}  \right
\}\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(a = c\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b = d\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>It is tempting to generalize the long Kuratowski definition from
pairs to tuples. For instance, the triple <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle a,b,c \right \rangle\)</span> would
correspond to the set <span class="math inline">\(\left \{  \left \{ a
\right \}, \left \{ a,b \right \}, \left \{ a,b,c \right \} \right
\}\)</span>. However, this definition does not preserve the identity
requirement of tuples. Show that there are cases where <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle a,b,c \right \rangle \neq \left
\langle d,e,f \right \rangle\)</span> yet <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{  \left \{ a \right \}, \left \{ a,b
\right \}, \left \{ a,b,c \right \} \right \} = \left \{  \left \{ d
\right \}, \left \{ d,e \right \}, \left \{ d,e,f \right \} \right
\}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="when-does-the-kuratowski-definition-work">When does the
Kuratowski definition work?</h2>
<p>The proof above is mathematically sound, but it relies on specific
assumptions of set theory. For example, we assumed that it is impossible
for both <span class="math inline">\(c \neq d\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\{a\} = \{c,d\}\)</span> to be true at the same
time because a set with one member can never be identical to a set with
two members. While this is intuitive enough, it means that the proof is
tied to a notion of sets that satisfies this property. Change how sets
work, and the long Kuratowski definition will no longer be useful as an
alternative view of pairs.</p>
<p>While the troubles with the long Kuratowski definition stop there,
the short Kuratowski definition requires even more specialized
assumptions. This definition defines <span class="math inline">\(\left
\langle a,b \right \rangle\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\left
\{  a, \left \{ a,b \right \} \right \}\)</span> instead of <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{  \left \{ a \right \}, \left \{ a,b
\right \} \right \}\)</span>. It is this definition in particular that
seems to be a good fit for linguistics because of recent proposals that
sentence structure involves sets of the shape <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a, \left \{ a,b \right \} \right
\}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the sentence <em>My cat snored</em>. It is built from the
verb <em>snored</em> and the noun phrase <strong>my cat</strong>. One
common proposal is that this noun phrase is built by an operation called
<strong>Merge</strong>. Given a <strong>head</strong> <em>H</em> and
<strong>argument</strong> <em>A</em>, Merge combines them into the set
<span class="math inline">\(\left \{ \mathit{H}, \left \{ \mathit{H},
\mathit{A} \right \} \right \}\)</span>. In the case at hand, Merge
takes the head <em>my</em> and argument <em>cat</em> and combines them
into <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ \mathit{my}, \left \{
\mathit{my}, \mathit{cat} \right \} \right \}\)</span> (there are
linguistic reasons for assuming <em>my</em> is the head rather than
<em>cat</em>).</p>
<p>Applying the short Kuratowski definition to the set <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ \mathit{my}, \left \{ \mathit{my},
\mathit{cat} \right \} \right \}\)</span> yields the pair <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle \mathit{my}, \mathit{cat} \right
\rangle\)</span>, which is conceptually pleasing because it corresponds
to the string <em>my cat</em> that we actually see in the sentence
<em>my cat snored</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>What would be the set produced by merging <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ \mathit{my}, \left \{ \mathit{my},
\mathit{cat} \right \} \right \}\)</span> with <em>snored</em>, assuming
that <em>snored</em> is the head? Does this still produce the correct
linear order? That is to say, does the order of words in the resulting
pair correspond to the order of words in the sentence <em>my cat
snored</em>?</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Many linguists would argue that <em>snored</em> is itself built up
from smaller parts which correspond to the verb <em>snore</em> and the
past tense marker <em>ed</em>. Assuming that the past tense marker acts
as the head and the verb as the argument, <em>snored</em> corresponds to
the set <span class="math inline">\(\left \{  \mathit{ed}, \left
\{  \mathit{snore}, \mathit{ed}  \right \} \right \}\)</span>. What,
then, would be the result of merging this set with <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{  \mathit{my}, \left \{  \mathit{my},
\mathit{cat}  \right \} \right \}\)</span> as in the previous exercise?
What pair does this correspond to?</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Consider the sentence <em>The dog hates my cat</em>. Treating
<em>hates</em> as a single element, and assuming that it is a head that
first combines with <em>my cat</em>, we get the set <span
class="math inline">\(H \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  \mathit{hates},
\left \{  \mathit{hates}, \left \{  \mathit{my}, \left \{  \mathit{my},
\mathit{cat}  \right \} \right \} \right \} \right \}\)</span>.
Similarly, <em>the dog</em> corresponds to the set <span
class="math inline">\(A \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  \mathit{the}, \left
\{  \mathit{the}, \mathit{dog} \right \} \right \}\)</span>. What is the
result of combining the two if <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is
the head and <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> the argument? Can
this set be interpreted as a pair via the short Kuratowski definition?
If so, what is the corresponding pair?</p>
</div>
<p>At first glance it seems that the proof for the long Kuratowski
definition also works for its short counterpart. But this is truly at
first glance only. Consider the counterpart to Subcase 2.1 above. That
is to say, we assume <span class="math inline">\(\left \{  a, \left \{
a,b \right \}  \right \} = \left \{  c, \left \{ c,d \right \}  \right
\}\)</span> and furthermore assume towards a contradiction that <span
class="math inline">\(a = \{c, d\}\)</span>. The problem is that this
does not result in a contradiction. We have two cases to consider: <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b \right \} = c\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b \right \} = \left \{ c,d \right
\}\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b \right \} =
c\)</span>, then we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
a
    &amp;= \left \{ c, d \right \}
        \tag{Initial assumption that $a = \left \{ c,d \right \}$}\\
    &amp;= \left \{  \left \{ a,b \right \}, d \right \}
        \tag{Substitute $\left \{ a,b \right \}$ for $c$}\\
    &amp;= \left \{  \left \{  \left \{ c,d \right \} ,b \right \}, d
\right \}
        \tag{Initial assumption that $a = \left \{ c,d \right \}$}\\
    &amp;= \left \{  \left \{  \left \{ \left \{ a,b \right \} ,d \right
\} ,b \right \}, d \right \}
        \tag{Substitute $\left \{ a,b \right \}$ for $c$}\\
    &amp;\vdots\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>And if <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b \right \} = \left \{
c, d \right \}\)</span>, then by our previous assumption that <span
class="math inline">\(a = \left \{ c,d \right \}\)</span> we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
a
    &amp;= \left \{ c, d \right \}
        \tag{Initial assumption that $a = \left \{ c,d \right \}$}\\
    &amp;= \left \{ a, b \right \}
        \tag{Substitute\ $\left \{ a,b \right \}$ for $\left \{ c,b
\right \}$}\\
    &amp;= \left \{  \left \{ a,b \right \}, b \right \}
        \tag{Substitute $\left \{ a,b \right \}$ for $a$}\\
    &amp;= \left \{  \left \{ \left \{ a, b \right \}, b \right \}, b
\right \}
        \tag{Substitute $\left \{ a,b \right \}$ for $a$}\\
    &amp;\vdots\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Either way we end up with what looks like an infinite sequence of
substitutions, building an infinitely deep set where we never reach the
bottom. This may strike you as highly unintuitive and quite distinct
from how we have used sets so far. But remember what we said about sets:
a set can contain arbitrarily complex objects, including other sets.
This does not rule out a set that contains a set that contains a set
that contains a set, and so on, <em>ad infinitum</em>. We can rule it
out, of course, but we don’t have to. Mathematicians have produced many
different definitions of sets, which are called
<strong>axiomatizations</strong> of sets. Some axiomatizations allow
this kind of infinite nesting, and some do not.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The most commonly used axiomatization of sets is
<strong>ZFC</strong>, which is short for <strong>Zermelo-Fraenkel with
the axiom of choice</strong>. ZFC is very different from the naive
notion of sets we have been using as it makes no explicit distinction
between objects and collections of objects. In ZFC, everything is a
set.</p>
<p>ZFC consists of multiple axioms. One of them, the <strong>axiom of
regularity</strong>, does indeed rule out infinitely nested sets like
the ones we are building above. However, this axiom isn’t very important
for ZFC. One can remove it from the axioms and almost all the
interesting theorems that have been established for sets in ZFC still
hold.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="do-we-want-infinitely-nested-sets">Do we want infinitely nested
sets?</h2>
<p>There are over 100 years of mathematical research on sets that allow
such infinite nesting. This branch of mathematics is known as
<strong>non-well-founded set theory</strong>, and these infinite sets
are sometimes referred to as <strong>hypersets</strong>. Hypersets
aren’t just a mathematical curiosity, they have been used in linguistics
as the mathematical foundation of situation semantics, which models how
humans reason over situations. This is a very natural task that billions
of humans perform effortlessly each day. It does not look like human
cognition struggles with the concept of hypersets. On what grounds,
then, should we ban hypersets for sentence structure?</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be defined as <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a, S \right \}\)</span>. This is a
hyperset. Explain why!</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Can you think of an argument that sentences might be hypersets?</p>
</div>
<p>We can do it, of course, we can rule out hypersets with the stroke of
a pen. But it would be a stipulation whose only motivation is to save
the short Kuratowski definition as a convenient way of serializing the
sets we see in sentence structure. It would be tantamount to claiming
that human cognition does not involve hypersets when it comes to
sentence structure, but at the same time it is so deeply rooted in
mathematical sets that it even employs the short Kuratowski definition
of pairs. That is a peculiar claim to make.</p>
<p>Moreover, making this claim does not tell us anything deep or
profound about sentences. We are simply putting in place mathematical
assumptions to get the result we want. These mathematical assumptions
aren’t forced onto us by the empirical lay of the land. Whether we allow
hypersets or not has no empirical consequences, it is a purely
theory-internal decision. This does not constitute scientific progress,
it is a mathematical mirage.</p>
<p>To the extent that this proposal is supposed to capture a real
property, the math is at best orthogonal to it and at worst actively
obscures it. The exercises earlier in this unit reveal that the short
Kuratowski definition does not map the sets built by Merge to pairs with
an obvious linguistic interpretation. Invoking the short Kuratowski
definition has nothing to say on the problem of how the sets built by
Merge are mapped to the linear sequences that we call sentences, and it
is unclear what other property of language it could possibly be
capturing in an insightful manner. In the absence of a clear empirical
payoff, we should not open the can of worms that is hypersets, ZFC, the
axiom of regularity, and correspondences between sets and pairs. And if
a linguistic proposal lacks empirical substance, then it is worthless as
a claim about language no matter how elegantly it was derived from
mathematical set theory.</p>
