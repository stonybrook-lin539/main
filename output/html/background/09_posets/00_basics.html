</div>
<p>While sets are unstructured, they can be combined with an ordering
relation to yield a structured object. Usually, this will be a partial
order. A set with a partial order defined over it is a <strong>partially
ordered set</strong> or simply <strong>poset</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>In mathematical terms, a poset is usually treated as a tuple <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle S, R \right \rangle\)</span> that
consists of the set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and the order
<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> defined over its elements. Don’t
attach too much significance to this, it is just a matter of notation
and you wouldn’t want to apply the usual tuple operations to these
objects. For instance, we wouldn’t want to concatenate the posets <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle S_1, R_1 \right \rangle\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\left \langle S_2, R_2 \right
\rangle\)</span> to get a 4-tuple <span class="math inline">\(\left
\langle S_1, R_1, S_2, R_2 \right \rangle\)</span>, that doesn’t make
much sense.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <strong>partially ordered set</strong>, or simple
<strong>poset</strong>, is a pair <span class="math inline">\(\left
\langle S, R \right \rangle\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is some set and <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is a partial order over <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is also called the
<strong>carrier</strong> of the poset <span class="math inline">\(\left
\langle S, R \right \rangle\)</span>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The set of natural numbers is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \right \}\)</span>. By
itself, it has no internal order. But of course we can order the natural
numbers according to the familiar relation <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>, and then we get the poset <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle \mathbb{N}, \leq \right
\rangle\)</span>. The carrier of <span class="math inline">\(\left
\langle \mathbb{N}, \leq \right \rangle\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>We can take the set <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> of all
humans that ever lived or are currently alive. We then order this set by
the ancestor relation. Since that is a partial order, the result is a
poset.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="visualizing-posets">Visualizing posets</h2>
<p>Often it is very useful to visualize posets. In this case, elements
of the set are represented as nodes in a figure, and arrows between the
nodes indicate that they are related via the order relation. Here is
what this looks like for the natural numbers ordered by <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="natnum_lessthan_redundant.svg"
alt="natnum_lessthan_redundant.svg" /></p>
<p>This figure has multiple elements:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A node for each natural number <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</li>
<li>An arrow connecting each <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to
<span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>.</li>
<li>An arrow connecting each <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to
itself (because <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> is
reflexive).</li>
<li>An arrow connecting each <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to
<span class="math inline">\(n+2\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(n+3\)</span>, and so on (because <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> is transitive).</li>
</ol>
<p>The result is pretty convoluted because of the abundance of arrows.
It is customary to omit arrows that can be inferred from the properties
of the order. First one omits all arrows that can be inferred from
transitivity. That is to say, if there is an arrow from <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and another arrow from <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, we do not need an arrow from <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="natnum_lessthan_loops.svg"
alt="natnum_lessthan_loops.svg" /></p>
<p>And if we know that the ordering relation <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is reflexive, then we do not need all
the loops either.</p>
<p><img src="natnum_lessthan_simplified.svg"
alt="natnum_lessthan_simplified.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>Caution:</strong> due to these conventions, a depiction of
<span class="math inline">\(\left \langle \mathbb{N}, \leq \right
\rangle\)</span> will look the same as one for <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle \mathbb{N}, &lt; \right
\rangle\)</span>, but those are different posets.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Take the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ 0, -1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3, \ldots \right
\}\)</span> of integers. Let <span class="math inline">\(x \prec
y\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(x^2 \leq y^2\)</span>. Sketch
or describe in words a figure of the poset <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle \mathbb{Z}, \prec \right
\rangle\)</span>. Avoid all arrows that can be inferred from the general
properties of <span class="math inline">\(\prec\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be the set of all
substrings of the word <em>poset</em>. Draw or describe in words the
poset <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle S, \sqsubset \right
\rangle\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\sqsubset\)</span>
is the proper substring relation: <span class="math inline">\(x
\sqsubset y\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span>
and there are (possibly empty) strings <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(u
\cdot x \cdot v = y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now suppose that we used <span
class="math inline">\(\sqsubseteq\)</span> instead: <span
class="math inline">\(x \sqsubseteq y\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(x \sqsubset y\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span>. Do you have to change anything
about your figure or description?</p>
