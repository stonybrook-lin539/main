<h1 id="how-to-read-mathematics">How to read mathematics</h1>
<p>While this book is designed to be as approachable as possible, a
certain mathematical style of writing is indispensable. This includes
special notation, some math-specific jargon, and even a particular way
of interpreting English sentences. Mathematicians do not do this to
sound smarter than they are or to isolate themselves from the uninformed
layman, but because it makes it easier for them to communicate their
ideas. This is no different from any other field of research — a
specialized field of study requires a specialized means of
communication. It will take you a while to get used to this way of
talking and writing, but here are a few tips to make sure you don’t
throw in the towel too early.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-symbol-shock">Dealing with symbol shock</h2>
<p>The most salient aspect of mathematical communication is the heavy
reliance on special symbols. This starts with formulas like <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) = kx + d\)</span> and quickly develops into
very complex statements. Here’s a small sample for your entertainment.
If you don’t understand a word and can feel your blood pressure spike,
that’s exactly the point!</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> be a totally
ordered collection of languages <span class="math inline">\(L_1, \ldots,
L_n\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1\)</span>) such that
for all <span class="math inline">\(1 \leq i,j \leq n\)</span> we have
<span class="math inline">\(L_j \not\subseteq L_i\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(i &lt; j\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>For any given string <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and PCFG
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, the probability of <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{d
\in D_G(s)} \prod_{r \in d} p_G(r)\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(D_G(s)\)</span> is the set of derivation trees of
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> that yield <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>
is a tree bigram of a derivation tree, and <span
class="math inline">\(p_G(r)\)</span> is the probability of <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> according to <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>A <em><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-interval</em>, or simply
<em><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-val</em>, is a <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\(\left
\langle k,G_l, G_r, G_o, G_f \right \rangle\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(k \geq 1\)</span> and each <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is an SL-<span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> grammar that specifies, respectively,
the left edge, right edge, open slots, and the fillers. The
corresponding <em><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-val
formula</em> (with free variables <span
class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\ldots\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(x_k\)</span>) is <span
class="math display">\[\begin{multline*}
    \exists l,r
    \bigg [
        \bigwedge_{g \in G_l} \neg g(l)
        \wedge
        \bigwedge_{g \in G_r} \neg g(r)
        \wedge
        \bigwedge_{1 \leq i \leq k}
        \bigwedge_{g \in G_o} \neg g(x_i)
        \wedge
        l \prec x_1

    \bigg ]
\end{multline*}\]</span> For any empty <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\bigwedge_{g \in G} \neg g(x)\)</span> is always
satisfied.</p>
</div>
<p>Unless you’ve had previous mathematical training, these examples
probably make your eyes glaze over and your brain freeze in horror:
“What is this stuff? What’s <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>
again, why is there a big sigma, and what is the subscript there? Why
can’t they just say what they mean in plain English? I can’t understand
this, it’s hopeless, I’m just not made for math.” Don’t despair, you’ve
just experienced <strong>symbol shock</strong>.</p>
<p>Symbol shock refers to the phenomenon that just looking at a page of
math can be so disheartening that you can’t think clearly. It’s like
being at the base of Mount Everest, looking up, and feeling that you’ll
never be able to reach the top. So rather than trying you give up
immediately, or you overcompensate and rush forward in a frenzy without
paying attention to what you’re doing. Neither approach will get you to
the goal. In order to deal with symbol shock, you have to develop the
central survival skills of mathematics: <strong>take your time</strong>,
and <strong>keep a cool head</strong>.</p>
<p>You cannot read math like a novel or even your average textbook. An 8
page paper can easily keep you busy for days before you fully understand
it. Revolutionary proofs may only span a few pages yet take trained
mathematicians months to understand. Math takes time, so do not rush. As
soon as you internalize this simple rule, symbol shock will be much less
of a problem. When a new symbol is introduced, pause and commit it to
memory. When you see a complex formula, work through it symbol by symbol
until you understand what’s going on. Just. Take. Your. Time.</p>
<p>This is actually why I think that math is easier to learn from a book
than a class. With a text, you can reread every sentence until you get
it. You can go back three pages to revisit a point you thought was clear
to you but now seems to be at odds with what you’re reading. You can’t
do that in a lecture. But you actually have to do all those things, you
have to slow down, go back, reread. Math isn’t all that hard, but you
have to be very disciplined about it.</p>
<p>With time, you will get much better at reading math and it will take
you much less effort, but for the beginning I suggest that you do the
following to better deal with symbol shock:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assign colors to specific symbols and types of objects. In my
personal experience, I can tell pretty easily how well I understand a
mathematical text based on how I would color its math. At first, it’s
all just black, but as I gain a deeper understanding of the objects and
how they hang together I construct an internal coloring system for
myself. So grammars are blue, automata green, certain variables that
keep reoccurring are purple and teal, and so on. If you have a hardcopy
of this book in front of you, you can literally add colors to all the
symbols, and that way the logic of the pages will reveal itself more
clearly to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Think about <strong>why</strong> certain symbols were chosen.
Mathematicians care a great deal about good notation, and it really
shows. A math text with a well-designed notation is a pleasure to read.
There’s certain established conventions. For instance, indices are
usually chosen to be <span class="math inline">\(i, j, k\)</span>,
variables are <span class="math inline">\(x, y, z\)</span>, and
functions are <span class="math inline">\(f, g, h\)</span>. But that’s
just a rule of thumb. A labeling function may be <span
class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>, which looks like an <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> but is slightly different so that <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> can be used to refer to labels instead.
Never try to memorize notation in a brute-force manner, try to
understand the design principles behind it. If you know why the notation
looks the way it does, you’ll have a much easier time remembering even
minor details and nuances.</p></li>
<li><p>Set yourself realistic goals. Don’t attempt to read 20 pages in
one sitting. Instead, plan for 3 or 4 reading sessions of 5 pages each.
And go in with the expectation that you will have to read some passages
multiple times, and that you’ll have to go back a few pages to look up
some symbol or definition.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t give up. None of the things we cover are super-advanced
hardcore math problems that will make your head explode unless you have
an IQ of 150. What we are doing is the math-equivalent of running a 5k:
most college students aren’t fit enough to do it on their first try, but
they can reach that level with a few months of training. It requires
tenacity and discipline, though.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dealing-with-some-other-stumbling-blocks">Dealing with some
other stumbling blocks</h2>
<h3 id="no-implicatures">No implicatures</h3>
<p>Mathematical writing is also peculiar because, as we linguists like
to say, implicatures are often cancelled implicitly. That’s a smarty
pants way of saying that only the literal meaning is the intended one.
For the uninitiated reader, it is easy to miss something important by
assuming that a mathematical statement is more specific than it actually
is.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The phrase “Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be a set
containing two odd numbers” does not entail that <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> only contains two odd numbers. It could
contain all kinds of additional things, including other odd numbers, but
at the very least it contains two odd numbers. If we wanted the set to
contain two odd numbers and nothing else, we would have written “Let
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be a set containing exactly two
odd numbers, and nothing else”. Tricky, hmm?</p>
</div>
<p>Another common pitfall arises with statements that use
<em>every</em>. Consider the sentence “Every blue dragon is a chain
smoker”. Is this claim true or false? A linguist will tell you that it
is neither, and instead contains a presupposition violation (yes,
linguists like their fancy terms). It is a presupposition violation
because the sentence assumes that blue dragons exist, which they
obviously do not. A mathematician doesn’t care for such linguistic
subtleties and instead considers the statement true because there is no
counterexample to prove it wrong. Their chain of reasoning is as
follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There exists no blue dragon that isn’t a chain smoker.</li>
<li>Hence there is no counterexample to the claim that every blue dragon
is a chain smoker.</li>
<li>Since there is no counterexample to the statement “Every blue dragon
is a chain smoker”, it isn’t false.</li>
<li>Since the statement “Every blue dragon is a chain smoker” isn’t
false, it is true.</li>
</ol>
<p>That reasoning is perfectly fine for mathematics, but it’s very
different from how a layperson would think about the statement “Every
blue dragon is a chain smoker”. Again, when dealing with math you
shouldn’t assume anything that isn’t stated explicitly.</p>
<p>Quite generally, you should try to identify minimal examples: when
you see a statement or definition, always think about the simplest
object that satisfies it, and ask yourself how much this object can
change before it no longer fits the description.</p>
<div class="advice">
<p>Don’t assume more than what was actually said.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="questioning-definitions">Questioning definitions</h3>
<p>Speaking of definitions, you should always ask yourself why something
is defined the way it is. I don’t mean this in some kind of
existentialist way like “What does it mean to be red?”, but a
utilitarian one: considering that we could have defined something in a
million slightly different ways, what might be the reason that this is
considered the most useful, elegant or productive definition? Remember,
definitions cannot be true or false, they can only be useful or useless.
According to biologists, tomatoes aren’t vegetables, yet that doesn’t
mean that their definition of <em>vegetable</em> is false. It just means
that their definition serves a specific use case that does not align
with common usage. So whenever you encounter a definition, you should
ask yourself what is it that makes that definition useful. Why did the
person decide to go with this definition rather than some other
conceivable alternative? In exploring this question, you will get a much
better understanding of what the definition even defines, and that is
key to studying the kind of object that is being defined.</p>
<div class="advice">
<p>Think about why things are defined the way they are.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="making-definitions-concrete">Making definitions concrete</h3>
<p>Another helpful strategy in dealing with definitions is to come up
with two distinct lists: examples that fit the definition, and examples
that do not fit the definition. Both are equally important. Sometimes a
definition may be so abstract and general that it is hard to see what
would not fit the definition. In seeking out those examples, you gain a
much better idea of the defined class of objects.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the following example, which is a lot more abstract than
most of the things you will encounter in this book: An <em>algebra</em>
is a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with an operation that
takes elements of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> as input and
produces elements of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> as its
output.</p>
<p>That is a very general definition, and there are tons of things that
are algebras in this sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>the natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, …) with addition: you take two
natural numbers, add them together, and you still have a natural
number.</li>
<li>the integers (…, -3, -2, -1 0, 1, 2, 3, …) with subtraction: you
take two integers, subtract the second from the first, and you’ll still
have an integer</li>
<li>the real numbers with base 2 logarithm: if you don’t know yet what
that means, rest assure that you will learn about logarithms at some
point in this book</li>
<li>the set of all possible strings with concatenation: again, you will
know very soon what this means</li>
</ul>
<p>But with such a general description, what could possibly fail to be
an algebra? Well, the natural numbers with division, for instance. The
natural numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on, but <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\)</span>, which is not a natural
number. This shows that division can take two natural numbers as input
and return something that is not a natural number. Hence the natural
numbers with division is not an algebra.</p>
</div>
<p>A brief remark: If you’re worried now because this example mentioned
natural numbers, integers, logarithms, or anything else you don’t quite
remember from your high school days, don’t despair. While these are
convenient examples for mathematical concepts, we won’t actually
encounter them all that often. They certainly aren’t the focus of this
book, and high school math will rarely make an appearance. Where we do
need these concepts, they’re slowly introduced like any other new
concept. So don’t let this distract you, focus on the important insight
here:</p>
<div class="advice">
<p>Whenever you see an abstract definition, think about what kind of
more concrete objects would (not) fit the definition.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="implication-and-equivalence-are-not-the-same">Implication and
equivalence are not the same</h3>
<p>English, as all natural languages, is pretty sloppy in how it
expresses conditions. Consider the following lovely sentence: “If you
don’t give me your money, I will shoot you”. Now the common
understanding is that you won’t be shot as long as you hand over your
money. But if your robber happens to be a mathematician you are very
unlucky because they might still shoot you — while you draw your final
breath they will gleefully point out that they didn’t say “If you don’t
give me your money, I will shoot you, and if you give me your money I
will not shoot you.” Your murderer took advantage of the fact that
English often expresses a biconditional (<span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> implies <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and the other way round) with the same
language we use for implications (<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>
implies <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, but <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> does not necessarily imply <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>).</p>
<div class="example">
<p>In “If you don’t give me your money, I will shoot you”, the
<em>if</em> is a biconditional: whichever choice you make fully
determines what the robber will do next. Not forking over your
hard-earned cash implies getting shot by the robber, and getting shot by
the robber implies that you chose not to fork over your hard-earned
cash. But the very same <em>if</em> is just an implication in “If it
rains, the road is wet”: if it does not rain, the road may still be wet,
e.g. because of a homeowner’s overzealous sprinklers. Here the absence
of rain does not imply the absence of wet roads. It is an implication,
but not a biconditional.</p>
</div>
<p>English does not explicitly mark the distinction between a
biconditional and an implication, the reader is supposed to figure it
out from context. But in mathematics, the distinction is very important,
and this is why mathematicians explicit distinguish the implication
<em>if</em> from the biconditional <em>iff</em> (which is short for
<em>if and only if</em>). So pay close attention to whether the text
uses an <em>if</em> or an <em>iff</em>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The following is an implication but not an equivalence/biconditional:
“If you are an actress, then you are female”. After all, not every
female is an actress. On the other hand, “You are a bachelor iff you are
an unmarried man” is a biconditional. Every unmarried man is a bachelor,
and every bachelor (in the non-academic sense) is an unmarried man.</p>
</div>
<div class="advice">
<p>Never confuse the conditional <em>if</em> with the biconditional
<em>iff</em>.</p>
