<h1 id="common-abbreviations">Common abbreviations</h1>
<h2 id="w.l.o.g.---without-loss-of-generality">w.l.o.g. - without loss
of generality</h2>
<p>This abbreviation is often used in proofs. It means that we assume a
specific property or condition that does not affect the validity of the
proof. Here is an example:</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p>If somebody is holding three marbles in their hands, then at least
one hand is holding at least two marbles.</p>
</div>
<div class="proof">
<p>Assume w.l.o.g. that the right hand is holding strictly less than two
marbles. So it is holding either no marbles or exactly one marble.
Either way the left hand is holding at least two marbles.</p>
</div>
<p>The use of <em>w.l.o.g.</em> here modifies the restriction to the
<em>right</em> hand. This restriction is made so that one does not have
to speak of <em>one hand</em> and <em>the other hand</em>, which makes
the proof slightly more readable. But obviously the proof would work
just as well if we had assumed that it is the left hand that holds less
than two marbles, not the right one.</p>
