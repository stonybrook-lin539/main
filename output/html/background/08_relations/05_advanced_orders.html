<h1 id="types-of-relations">Types of relations</h1>
<p>Weak partial orders and total orders are just two particular types of
relations. There are several others.</p>
<h2 id="preorder">Preorder</h2>
<p>The most basic order relation is the <strong>preorder</strong>, which
is like a weak partial order but lacks antisymmetry. So it is transitive
and reflexive, but not necessarily anything beyond that.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A relation <span class="math inline">\(R \subseteq D \times
D\)</span> is a <strong>preorder</strong> iff it is reflexive and
transitive.</p>
</div>
<p>If one takes a preorder and adds antisymmetry, one gets a weak
partial order. If one adds symmetry instead, one gets an
<strong>equivalence relation</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="relation_types.svg" alt="relation_types.svg" /></p>
<h2 id="equivalence-relations">Equivalence relations</h2>
<div class="definition">
<p>A relation <span class="math inline">\(R \subseteq D \times
D\)</span> is an <strong>equivalence relation</strong> iff it is
reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.</p>
</div>
<p>Intuitively, an equivalence relation does exactly what its name
implies: it relates elements that are equivalent with respect to some
property that the relation is sensitive to.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>One equivalence relation that everybody is familiar with is the
equality <span class="math inline">\(=\)</span> of numbers. But it isn’t
a particularly insightful relation. It is reflexive as <span
class="math inline">\(n = n\)</span> for every number <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. It also satisfies symmetry and
transitivity, but that’s because <span class="math inline">\(x =
y\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are the same number. So symmetry holds
because <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span> obviously implies
<span class="math inline">\(y = x\)</span> if <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are the same number. For the same
reason, transitivity must hold, too: <span class="math inline">\(x =
y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y = z\)</span> can be the
case only if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> are all the same number, in which case
<span class="math inline">\(x = z\)</span> is of course true.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>A more interesting example is equivalence modulo <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. The modulo <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> operation divdies a number by <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and returns the remainder. For example,
<span class="math inline">\(5 \mod 2 = 1\)</span>, whereas <span
class="math inline">\(6 \mod 2 = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(x \equiv_2 y\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(x \mod 2 = y \mod 2\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(\equiv_2\)</span> is an equivalence relation.
First, it is clearly refleixve: <span class="math inline">\(x \equiv_2
x\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(x \mod 2 = x \mod 2\)</span>,
which always holds. Next, symmetry is also satisfied: <span
class="math inline">\(x \equiv_2 y\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(x \mod 2 = y \mod 2\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(y \mod 2 = x \mod 2\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(y \equiv_2 x\)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="equivalence-classes-and-partitions">Equivalence classes and
partitions</h2>
<p>Given an equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(R \subseteq
D \times D\)</span> and element <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\([x]\)</span> is the <strong>equivalence
class</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. It contains
all elements that are equivalent to <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> according to <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. Formaly, <span
class="math inline">\([x] \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  y \mid x R y
\right \}\)</span>. Keep in mind that <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is reflexive, so <span
class="math inline">\(x \in [x]\)</span>.</p>
<p>Also, symmetry and transitivity entail that <span
class="math inline">\(x \in [y]\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(y \in [x]\)</span>. So it follows from <span
class="math inline">\(x \in [y]\)</span> that <span
class="math inline">\([x] = [y]\)</span>. Hence it doesn’t matter which
member of an equivalence class one uses in its name, there is no
difference between <span class="math inline">\([x]\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\([y]\)</span> if <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> belong go the same equivalence
class.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider again the modulo 2 relation <span
class="math inline">\(\equiv_2\)</span>. It gives rise to two
equivalence classes. The first ist <span class="math inline">\([0]
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ 0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots \right \}\)</span>, which
contains all even numbers, and the other is <span
class="math inline">\([1] \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ 1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots
\right \}\)</span>, the set of odd numbers. We could also refer to them
as <span class="math inline">\([2]\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\([3]\)</span>, respectively, or <span
class="math inline">\([10]\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\([7]\)</span>, it really does not matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Intuitively, what equivalence classes does the continent mate
relation yield?</p>
</div>
<p>Note that equivalence classes never overlap, they are disjoint sets.
Given a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and an equivalence
relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, no member of <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> can belong to more than one equivalence
class.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(x \in [y]\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x \in [z]\)</span>, but <span
class="math inline">\([y] \neq [z]\)</span>. Why is this impossible?</p>
</div>
<p>In addition, an equivalence relation over a set <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is usually chosen in such a way that
every element of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> belongs to an
equivalence class.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>In principle, one could combine the set <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b,c \right \}\)</span> with the
equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(R
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ \left \langle a,a \right \rangle, \left
\langle a,b \right \rangle, \left \langle b,a \right \rangle, \left
\langle b,b \right \rangle \right \}\)</span>. But it is more natural to
extend the relation to <span class="math inline">\(R&#39;
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ \left \langle a,a \right \rangle, \left
\langle a,b \right \rangle, \left \langle b,a \right \rangle, \left
\langle b,b \right \rangle, \left \langle c,c \right \rangle \right
\}\)</span>. Intuitively, <span class="math inline">\(R&#39;\)</span> is
exactly like <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> except that there is
also an equivalence class for elements that <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is not defined for.</p>
</div>
<p>Given these assumptions, every member of <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> belongs to exactly one equivalence
class. The equivalence classes thus add an additional layer of structure
to <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. They break it down into a
collection of non-overlapping, non-empty subsets (the equivalence
classes) that fully cover <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. This
is also called a <strong>partition</strong> of <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, and one says that <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> partitions <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Each equivalence class is also called
a <strong>cell</strong> of the partition.</p>
<h2 id="quotient-structure">Quotient structure</h2>
<p>Given an equivalence relation <span
class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S/\sim
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  [x] \mid x \in S \right \}\)</span> is the
partition <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> induces on <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. This is also called a <strong>quotient
set</strong> (yes, there’s many different names for the same thing
here). Sometimes, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> may have some
additional operation or relation defined on it. It may be possible to
lift this operation or relation from <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to its quotient set <span
class="math inline">\(S/\sim\)</span>. In this case, one obtains a
<strong>quotient structure</strong>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider once more the equivalence relation <span
class="math inline">\(\equiv_2\)</span>. Over the natural numbers, it
induces a quotient set consisting of <span
class="math inline">\([0]\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\([1]\)</span>, the even and odd numbers,
respectively. Now suppose that we add addition as an operation to the
natural numbers. Then it holds that <span class="math inline">\((m + n)
\mod 2 = ([m] + [n]) \mod 2\)</span>. In other words, there are two
different ways of computing the desired result. The first option
operates on <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. One adds the two
numbers and then takes the sum modulo 2. Alternatively, one can look at
the quotient set. Take the two equivalence classes, and take their sum
by picking the smallest number from each equivalence class and adding
them together. Then apply modulo 2 as before.</p>
<p>Here’s what this looks like with specific numbers. Suppose you want
to calculate <span class="math inline">\((10,222 + 13,728,529) \mod
2\)</span>. You could add this up to <span
class="math inline">\(13,738,751\)</span>, divide by two, and get a
remainder of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. But you probably
realized right away that the first number is even and the second one
odd, so their sum will be odd, which means that division by 2 will leave
a remainder of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. In other words,
you have computed the result with the quotient structure. First you
noted that <span class="math inline">\(10,222 \in [0]\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(13,728,529 \in [1]\)</span>. As <span
class="math inline">\([0] + [1] = 0 + 1 = 1\)</span>, you immediately
get a remainder of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Quotient structures are a very powerful concept, in particular when
it comes to designing efficient algorithms. A set may contain millions
of elements, and the operations on the set may take a long time to
compute on some of those elements. But you might be able to build a much
smaller quotient structure, and the operations may be faster over
equivalence classes because you can pick very simple representatives of
each class. After all, <span class="math inline">\((3 + 5) \mod
7\)</span> is a much easier way to calculate the output of <span
class="math inline">\((7,003 + 14,726) \mod 7\)</span>.</p>
