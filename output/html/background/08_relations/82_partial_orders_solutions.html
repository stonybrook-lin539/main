<p>Give two arguments modeled after the ones above to show that <span

<div class="exercise">
<p>Earlier on we encountered the human ancestor relation. Is this
relation antisymmetric?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>In a world without time travel, it is antisymmetric. In a world with
time travel, it might not be antisymmetric.</p>
</div>
<div class="solution_explained">
<p>Antisymmetry trivially holds of any relation <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> for which one cannot find any <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that both <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span> hold. This is the case of
the human ancestor relation in the real world. If <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is an ancestor of <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> cannot be an ancestor of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Antisymmetry holds because we cannot
even find any scenario where it could be possibly violated.</p>
<p>But now consider the case of Futurama’s Philip J. Fry, who
(spoilers!) travels back in time, does the nasties with his grandma, and
ends up fathering his own father. This means that Fry is an ancestor of
his father, and of course Fry’s father is an ancestor of Fry. Yet Fry
and his father are not the same person. Antisymmetry is violated.</p>

<div class="exercise">
<p>There is no relation that is reflexive, and irreflexive, and
non-reflexive. Explain why!</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>A relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is non-reflexive
iff there is some <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} x\)</span> and some <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(y

\mathrel{R} x\)</span> rules out that <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is irreflexive, and <span
class="math inline">\(y \not\mathrel{R} y\)</span> rules out that <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is reflexive. So non-reflexivity is
incompatible with reflexivity, and it is also incompatible with
irreflexivity.</p>
<p>Note, however, that reflexivity and irreflexivity are not
incompatible. Any relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> over
the empty set is both reflexive and irreflexive: since there is no <span
class="math inline">\(x \in \emptyset\)</span> such that <span

counterexample to <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> being

<li>the “sums to 10” relation (<span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R}

<li>the “voted for the same candidate” relation: reflexive; although it

<li>the “parent-of” relation over humans in a world with time travel:
non-reflexive or irreflexive. In a normal world this would be
irreflexive because no human can be their own parent. But in a world
with time travel some person <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
could travel back in time, do the nasties with their parent of the
opposite sex, and end up fathering/mothering themselves, which would
mean the relation is no longer irreflexive but just non-reflexive. Then
again, human offspring randomly inherits 50% of each parent’s DNA, so
the odds of this act resulting in exactly the same human <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that traveled back in time are
basically null, making the relation irreflexive after all. Then again,
this could be a predestination paradox, in which case the offspring of
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> must be <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> because otherwise there would be no
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to go back in time to father

and <em>rotator</em>, but for most words <span class="math inline">\(x

<div class="exercise">
<p>Explain in intuitive terms why the two definitions of strict partial
orders are equivalent.</p>
<p><em>Hint:</em> You have to explain why asymmetry is essentially the
combination of antisymmetry and irreflexivity.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>We have to show that a relation is asymmetric iff it is both
antisymmetric and irreflexive. Intuitively, this clearly holds. The
definition of asymmetry says that the relation must not contain any
loops, whereas antisymmetry says that the only permitted loops are
self-loops, which in turn are ruled out by irreflexivity.</p>
<p>More formally, suppose that <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is
asymmetric. Then for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} y\)</span> entails <span class="math inline">\(y
\not\mathrel{R} x\)</span>. But then antisymmetry trivially holds
because there are no <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that both <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span>. In addition, asymmetry
enforces that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} x\)</span>
entails <span class="math inline">\(x \not\mathrel{R} x\)</span>. Since
this is a contradiction, the only way asymmetry can hold is if there is
no <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} x\)</span>. In other words, <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is irreflexive.</p>
<p>In the other direction, suppose that <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is antisymmetric and irreflexive. Then
<span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span> imply <span
class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span>. But if <span
class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} y\)</span> is actually <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} x\)</span>, which violates irreflexivity. Hence there must
not be any <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R}
x\)</span> are both true. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} y\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(y
\not\mathrel{R} x\)</span>, which is exactly the definition of
asymmetry.</p>
