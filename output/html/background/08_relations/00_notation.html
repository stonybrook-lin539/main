<p>Relations are similar to functions in that they establish connections
between objects. But whereas a function associates only one output with
every input, a relation is more flexible and allows connections to
arbitrarily many elements.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The question <em>Is <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> a
biological child of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></em> is a
function because it maps any two <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to either true or false, but
never both. But if we slightly change the question to just <em>Name a
biological child of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></em>, we are
no longer dealing with a function because multiple answers are possible
if <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> has more than one child.
Instead, we can talk about the <em>biological child</em> relation <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is related to <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> via <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a biological child of <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="basic-notation">Basic notation</h2>
<p>Given some relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, we write
<span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> to indicate that
<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> relates <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Note that <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> does not imply that <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span> also holds, nor that
<span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span> doesn’t hold.
Either one may be the case.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>One relation you know very well is the “less than” relation <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> over numbers. When we write <span
class="math inline">\(5 &lt; 7\)</span>, we are saying that the relation
<span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> relates <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(7\)</span>. However, it is not the case that <span
class="math inline">\(7\)</span> is related to <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> via <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(7
&lt; 5\)</span> does not hold.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose <em>John</em> has exactly two siblings, <em>Mary</em> and
<em>Sue</em>. Then the sibling relation establishes two connections for
John: <em>John</em>-<em>Mary</em>, and <em>John</em>-<em>Sue</em>. Using
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> for the sibling relation, we have
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{John} \mathrel{S}
\mathrm{Mary}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{John}
\mathrel{S} \mathrm{Sue}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In contrast to <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, the sibling
relation is <strong>symmetric</strong>. That is to say, if Mary is a
sibling of John, then John is also a sibling of Mary. Therefore we also
have <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Mary} \mathrel{S}
\mathrm{John}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Sue}
\mathrel{S} \mathrm{John}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The relation is also <strong>transitive</strong>. If John is a
sibling of Mary, and Sue is a sibling of John, then Sue is a sibling of
Mary. So it also holds that <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Mary}
\mathrel{S} \mathrm{Sue}\)</span>, and via symmetry we also get <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Sue} \mathrel{S}
\mathrm{Mary}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Overall, we have <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{S} y\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in \left \{ \mathrm{John},
\mathrm{Mary}, \mathrm{Sue} \right \}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The <strong>substring relation</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(\sqsubseteq\)</span> holds between two strings
<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is a substring of <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. That is to say, <span
class="math inline">\(u \subseteq v\)</span> iff there are <span
class="math inline">\(w, w&#39; \in \Sigma^*\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(w \cdot u \cdot w&#39; = v\)</span>. Note that for
any given string <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, there are
infinitely many <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> that <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is a substring of. Even if the alphabet
contains only <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, the string <span
class="math inline">\(aa\)</span> is a substring of <span
class="math inline">\(aaa\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(aaaa\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(aaaaa\)</span>, and so on, ad infinitum. It is
also a substring of itself (in this case, <span class="math inline">\(w
= w&#39; = \varepsilon\)</span>).</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Relations can be defined over more complex objects like sets. An
example of this is the subset relation <span
class="math inline">\(\subseteq\)</span>. The set <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1 \right \}\)</span> is a subset of
infinitely many other sets: <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 0,1
\right \}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2 \right
\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 0,1,2 \right
\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,3 \right
\}\)</span>, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Just like a function can take multiple arguments to return a single
output, a relation can connect multiple elements. In the real world, the
“jointly conceived” relation <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span>
would connect two individuals to their offspring. So the expression
<span class="math display">\[\mathrm{John}, \mathrm{Mary} \mathrel{R}
\mathrm{Sue}\]</span> encodes that John and Mary are the biological
parents of Sue (let’s just hope that those are not the same people as in
the first example).</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Here is an example of a very abstract relation. Consider the space of
all possible functions from real numbers to real numbers — that’s a lot
of functions. Now let’s define a boundedness relation <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> which relates function <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to function <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(f(x)
\leq g(x)\)</span> for every natural number <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Suppose, for instance, that <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) = x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(f \mathrel{B} g\)</span>, but not <span
class="math inline">\(g \mathrel{B} f\)</span>.</p>
<p>Many functions aren’t related via <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> at all. One example of this is <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) = -x + 1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2\)</span>. It is the case that <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) \leq g(x)\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(x \geq 1\)</span>, but <span
class="math inline">\(f(0) = 1 &gt; 0 = g(0)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>We will mostly be dealing with the special case of <strong>binary
relations</strong> where exactly one element is related to some other
element.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Almost all relations above are binary relations. The only exception
is the “jointly conceived” relation <span
class="math inline">\(J\)</span>, which is a ternary relation as it
relates three elements.</p>
</div>
<p>Given a binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R}\)</span> is the set of objects that
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is related to. Similarly, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrel{R} b\)</span> is the set of objects that
are related to <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[
a \mathrel{R} \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  b \mid a \mathrel{R} b \right
\}
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
\mathrel{R} b \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  a \mid a \mathrel{R} b \right
\}
\]</span></p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose that the parent-of relation <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> establishes the following relations
between elements: <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{John} \mathrel{P}
\mathrm{Sue}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Mary}
\mathrel{P} \mathrm{Sue}\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{John} \mathrel{P} = \left \{ \mathrm{Sue}
\right \}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrel{P}
\mathrm{Sue} = \left \{  \mathrm{John}, \mathrm{Mary} \right
\}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be the relation that
connects words to their parts of speech (N for nouns, V for verbs, A for
adjectives, P for prepositions, D for determiners, and so on). List the
following for English:</p>
<ul>
<li>export <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span></li>
<li>apple <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> P</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="relations-versus-functions">Relations versus functions</h2>
<p>Every function can be regarded as a relation.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the function <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{N}
\rightarrow \mathbb{N}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x
\mapsto 2x\)</span>. It is identical to the relation <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} y\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(y =
2x\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The crucial difference between functions and relations is that
functions are <strong>right-unique relations</strong>. That’s a fancy
way of saying that a function cannot provide more than one output,
whereas a relation can unless it is right-unique. When we view a
function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> as a relation <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, then it must hold for every <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\(a
\mathrel{R}\)</span> is either empty or contains exactly one element.
Hence the term right-unique: if we look at the expression <span
class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the left side and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> the right side. If there cannot be more
than one choice for <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, then the
right side of <span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} b\)</span> is
uniquely determined.</p>
<p>The bottom line: every function is a relation, but not every relation
is a function. If <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is related to
two elements or more (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\left | a
\mathrel{R} \right | \geq 2\)</span>), then <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> cannot be a function.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following, say whether it is a function or just a
relation.</p>
<ul>
<li>the parent-of relation (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(j
\mathrel{P} m\)</span> for “John is a parent of Mary”)</li>
<li>the parent-of relation in a world where the one-child policy is
enforced globally</li>
<li>the relation between a car’s license plate and its owners</li>
<li>the prefix relation, where <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is
a prefix of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> iff there is some
<span class="math inline">\(w \in \Sigma^*\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(v = u \cdot w\)</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Is the following statement true or false? Justify your answer.</p>
<p>Every relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> can be regarded
as a function that maps <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R}\)</span>.</p>
</div>

<li>Relations are a generalization of functions in that a single input
can be related to many distinct outputs.</li>
