</ul>
</div>
<p>Relations are similar to functions in that they establish connections
between objects. But whereas a function associates only one output with
every input, a relation is more flexible and allows connections to
arbitrarily many elements.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The question <em>Is <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> a
biological child of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></em> is a
function because it maps any two <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to either true or false, but
never both. But if we slightly change the question to just <em>Name a
biological child of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></em>, we are
no longer dealing with a function because multiple answers are possible
if <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> has more than one child.
Instead, we can talk about the <em>biological child</em> relation <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is related to <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> via <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a biological child of <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="infix-notation">Infix notation</h2>
<p>Given some relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, we write
<span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> to indicate that
<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> relates <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. We could also write <span
class="math inline">\(R(x, y)\)</span>, but the <strong>infix
notation</strong> <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span>
is more common and also highlights that <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is not a function.</p>
<p>Note that without additional assumptions, <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> does not imply that <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span> also holds, nor does it
imply that that <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span>
doesn’t hold. Either one may be the case.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>One relation you know very well is the “less than” relation <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> over numbers. When we write <span
class="math inline">\(5 &lt; 7\)</span>, we are saying that the relation
<span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> relates <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(7\)</span>. However, it is not the case that <span
class="math inline">\(7\)</span> is related to <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> via <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(7
&lt; 5\)</span> does not hold.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose <em>John</em> has exactly two siblings, <em>Mary</em> and
<em>Sue</em>. Then the sibling relation establishes two connections for
John: <em>John</em>-<em>Mary</em>, and <em>John</em>-<em>Sue</em>. Using
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> for the sibling relation, we have
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{John} \mathrel{S}
\mathrm{Mary}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{John}
\mathrel{S} \mathrm{Sue}\)</span>.</p>
<p>But the sibling relation is an example of a relation where <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> implies <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span>. It simply is impossible
for John to be a sibling of Mary without Mary also being a sibling of
John. Therefore we also have <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Mary}
\mathrel{S} \mathrm{John}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Sue} \mathrel{S}
\mathrm{John}\)</span>.</p>
<p>And of course if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a sibling
of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is a sibling of some <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> distinct from <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a sibling of <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. So it also holds that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Mary} \mathrel{S} \mathrm{Sue}\)</span>,
and since <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{S} y\)</span> implies
<span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{S} x\)</span>, we also have <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Sue} \mathrel{S} \mathrm{Mary}\)</span>.
Overall, we have <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{S} y\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in \left \{ \mathrm{John},
\mathrm{Mary}, \mathrm{Sue} \right \}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Keep in mind that relations can establish infinitely many connections
between objects.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider once more the “less than” relation <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> over numbers. We saw that <span
class="math inline">\(5 &lt; 7\)</span> holds, but of course we also
have <span class="math inline">\(5 &lt; 6\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(5 &lt; 8\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(5
&lt; 9\)</span>, and so on. The relation <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> establishes connections between
<span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> and infinitely many other
numbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The <strong>substring relation</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(\sqsubseteq\)</span> holds between two strings
<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is a substring of <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. For instance, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{ab}\)</span> is a substring of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{abaa}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{aaab}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{bbabaa}\)</span>, among many others, and
it is also a substring of itself. In fact, it holds for any arbitrary
string <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> that there are infinitely
many <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(u \sqsubseteq v\)</span>. Even if the alphabet
contains only <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, the string <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{aa}\)</span> is a substring of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{aaa}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{aaaa}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{aaaaa}\)</span>, and so on, ad infinitum.
Hence <span class="math inline">\(\sqsubseteq\)</span> contains
infinitely many statements of the form <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{aa} R v\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is some string.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="more-complex-examples">More complex examples</h2>
<p>There are no restrictions on what kind of objects may be related by a
relation. Relations can be defined over individuals, sets, even
functions and other relations.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The subset relation <span class="math inline">\(\subseteq\)</span> is
a relation between sets. The set <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1
\right \}\)</span> is a subset of infinitely many other sets: <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 0,1 \right \}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2 \right \}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 0,1,2 \right \}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,3 \right \}\)</span>, and so on. Not
all sets are connected via the subset relation. For instance, neither
<span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1 \right \} \subseteq \left \{ 2
\right \}\)</span> nor <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 2 \right \}
\subseteq \left \{ 1 \right \}\)</span> hold.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Here is an example of a very abstract relation. Consider the space of
all possible functions from natural numbers to natural numbers — that’s
a lot of functions. Now let’s define a boundedness relation <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> which relates function <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to function <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(f(x)
\leq g(x)\)</span> for every natural number <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Suppose, for instance, that <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) = x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(f \mathrel{B} g\)</span>, but not <span
class="math inline">\(g \mathrel{B} f\)</span>.</p>
<p>Many functions aren’t related via <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> at all. One example of this is <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) = x + 1000\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(g(x) = x^2\)</span>. For large values of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, it holds that <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) \leq g(x)\)</span>: <span
class="math inline">\(f(100) = 100 + 1000 = 1,100\)</span>, which is
less than <span class="math inline">\(g(100) = 100^2 = 10,000\)</span>.
But for small values, we get the opposite: <span
class="math inline">\(f(1) = 1 + 1000 = 1,001\)</span> but <span
class="math inline">\(g(1) = 1^2 = 1\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="arity-of-relations">Arity of relations</h2>
<p>All of the examples we have seen so far where <strong>binary</strong>
relations where a single element is related to some other element. But
just like functions can take multiple arguments and map them to a single
value, a relation can connect multiple elements.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the “jointly conceived” relation <span
class="math inline">\(J\)</span>. For instance, John and Mary may have
jointly conceived Sue, but John may have also jointly conceived and Bill
with Flora. We could think of this as a ternary relation relating two
parents to one of their offspring, and we could write this as follows:
<span class="math display">\[\mathrm{John}, \mathrm{Mary} \mathrel{J}
\mathrm{Sue}\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[\mathrm{John},
\mathrm{Flora} \mathrel{J} \mathrm{Bill}.\]</span></p>
<p>You might be wondering why this could not be a binary relation as
indicated below:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{John} \mathrel{J}
\mathrm{Sue}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Mary} \mathrel{J}
\mathrm{Sue}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{John} \mathrel{J}
\mathrm{Bill}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Flora} \mathrel{J}
\mathrm{Bill}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We can still infer that Sue was jointly conceived by John and Mary,
and that Bill was jointly conceived by John and Flora. That is true,
but:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This is an extra inference step we have to make, the relation no
longer captures this fact. It is just because of our world knowledge
about how conception works that we know how to reconstruct the relation
we are actually interested in.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\mathrel{J}\)</span> were just a
binary relation, then it would be natural to add, say, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{John} \mathrel{J} \mathrm{Diana}\)</span>
to the statements above. But without a matching statement like <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Mary} \mathrel{J} \mathrm{Diana}\)</span>,
this would mean that John jointly conceived Diana all by himself, which
makes no sense. It seems more appropriate, then, to model this as a
ternary relation.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>We will be dealing exclusively with binary relations, so you do not
have to worry about relations of higher arity and why one might want to
use them in some cases.</p>
<h2 id="x-mathrelr-and-mathrelr-y-notation"><span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrel{R} y\)</span> notation</h2>
<p>Given a binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R}\)</span> is the set of objects that
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is related to, i.e. the set of
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> holds. Similarly, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrel{R} y\)</span> is the set of objects that
are related to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, i.e. the set of
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> holds.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose that the parent-of relation <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> establishes the following relations
between elements: <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{John} \mathrel{P}
\mathrm{Sue}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Mary}
\mathrel{P} \mathrm{Sue}\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{John} \mathrel{P} = \left \{ \mathrm{Sue}
\right \}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrel{P}
\mathrm{Sue} = \left \{  \mathrm{John}, \mathrm{Mary} \right
\}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be the relation that
connects words to their parts of speech (N for nouns, V for verbs, A for
adjectives, P for prepositions, D for determiners, and so on). List the
following for English:</p>
<ul>
<li>export <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span></li>
<li>apple <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> P</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="relations-versus-functions">Relations versus functions</h2>
<p>Every function can be regarded as a relation.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the function <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{N}
\rightarrow \mathbb{N}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x
\mapsto 2x\)</span>. It is identical to the relation <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} y\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(y =
2x\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The crucial difference between functions and relations is that
functions are <strong>right-unique relations</strong>. That’s a fancy
way of saying that a function cannot provide more than one output,
whereas a relation can unless it is right-unique. When we view a
function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> as a relation <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, then it must hold for every <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R}\)</span> is either empty or contains exactly one element.
Hence the term right-unique: if we look at the expression <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the left side and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> the right side. If there cannot be more
than one choice for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, then the
right side of <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> is
uniquely determined by <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>The bottom line: every function is a relation, but not every relation
is a function. If <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is related to
two elements or more (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\left | x
\mathrel{R} \right | \geq 2\)</span>), then <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> cannot be a function.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following, say whether it is a function or just a
relation. If you have to make additional assumptions, state them
explicitly.</p>
<ul>
<li>the parent-of relation (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(j
\mathrel{P} m\)</span> for “John is a parent of Mary”)</li>
<li>the parent-of relation in a world where a strict one-child policy
has been enforced globally</li>
<li>the relation between a car’s license plate and its owners</li>

class="math inline">\(w \in \Sigma^*\)</span> such that <span

class="math inline">\(\mathit{ab}\)</span> is a prefix of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{abbaaa}\)</span>)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Is the following statement true or false? Justify your answer.</p>
<p>Every relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> can be regarded

class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="formal-definition">Formal definition</h2>
<p>There are multiple ways to define binary relations depending on
whether one thinks of them as relating elements drawn from a single set,
or as relating elements from some set <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to elements of some set <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. The former is more standard and will
also be more natural for all the scenarios we will encounter.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <strong>binary relation</strong> <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> over some fixed set <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is a (possibly infinite) set of
statements of the form <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R}
y\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(x \in S\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y \in S\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that by this definition, relations are just sets whose elements
happen to specify a relation. This means that we can apply set-theoretic
operations to relations as usual.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(R \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ a
\mathrel{R} b, b \mathrel{R} c \right \}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(R&#39; \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ a \mathrel{R}
b, c \mathrel{R} b \right \}\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(R \cup R&#39; = \left \{ a \mathrel{R} b, b
\mathrel{R} c, c \mathrel{R} b \right \}\)</span>.</p>
