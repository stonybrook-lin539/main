<h1 id="strict-order-relations">Strict order relations</h1>
<p>There are numerous types of order relations. We will start out with
strict orders as the definitions are slightly more intuitive in this
case. After that, we will look at weak orders.</p>
<h2 id="strict-partial-orders-and-strict-total-orders">Strict partial
orders and strict total orders</h2>
<p>Strict orders can be partial or total. Their definitions are very
succinct, but require specialized vocabulary.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <strong>strict partial order</strong> is a binary relation <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> that is</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>transitive</strong>: for all <span class="math inline">\(x,
y, z\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span> jointly imply <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} z\)</span>, and</li>
<li><strong>irreflexive</strong>: there is no <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} x\)</span>, and</li>
<li><strong>asymmetric</strong>: for all <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, if <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} y\)</span>, then it is not the case that <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <strong>strict total order</strong> is a strict partial order that
is <strong>semiconnex</strong>: for all <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, if <span class="math inline">\(x \neq
y\)</span> then it holds that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R}
y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>These are very abstract definitions. In order to truly understand
them, you have to develop an intuitive grasp of what each property
means.</p>
<h2 id="transitivity">Transitivity</h2>
<p>Suppose you have some set <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> of
objects with a binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>
defined over them. For example, we may have the set of natural numbers
with the <em>strictly less than</em> relation <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, where we have <span
class="math inline">\(3 &lt; 5\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(4 &lt; 5\)</span>, but not <span
class="math inline">\(5 &lt; 5\)</span> (although <span
class="math inline">\(5 \leq 5\)</span>). We can think of these as
structures where the set specifies the collection of building blocks and
the relation connects these building blocks, putting them into a
particular structural configuration. We can move through <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> along <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>: if we are at <span
class="math inline">\(x \in D\)</span>, we can move to any <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} y\)</span>. And from <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>,
we can move on to any <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span>, and so on.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>From the natural number <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, we
can move to <span class="math inline">\(17\)</span> via <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, and from there to <span
class="math inline">\(329\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>This movement metaphor is very useful for understanding transitivity
and other properties of relations. Some relations are such that whatever
can be reached in two steps can also be reached in one step. So <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span> entail that we also have
<span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} z\)</span> — the ability to
move from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> via <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> implies that we can move directly from
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> without a stop at <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Such relations are called
<strong>transitive</strong>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is <strong>transitive</strong> iff for
all <span class="math inline">\(x,y,z \in D\)</span> it holds that <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span> jointly imply <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} z\)</span>. This must be the case
even if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> are not distinct.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The human ancestor relation <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is
transitive. Your mother is one of your ancestors, and every ancestor of
your mother is an ancestor of yourself. So <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{A} y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{A}
z\)</span> imply <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{A}
z\)</span>.</p>
<p>What about the sibling relation <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>? Well, if John is a sibling of Mary and
Mary is a sibling of Sue, then John is a sibling of Sue. So it looks
like it is transitive. But it’s not! For a relation to be transitive, it
is not enough that some cases obey transivitiy. All cases have to. So
let’s look at this counterexample: John is a sibling of Mary, and Mary
is a sibling of John, yet John is not his own sibling. In formal terms,
we have <span class="math inline">\(\text{John} \mathrel{S}
\text{Mary}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{Mary}
\mathrel{S} \text{John}\)</span>, yet <span
class="math inline">\(\text{John} \not\mathrel{S}
\text{John}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Many other relations are not transitive, either. The human parent-of
relation is not transitive, because there can be <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the parent of <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>
is the parent of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, but <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is not the parent of <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. In fact, that is how things are
supposed to go in the real world and every deviation from this case is
very problematic.</p>
<p>Sometimes a relation may partially meet the requirements of
transitivity, but not for all elements of the domain. We have already
seen this with the sibling relation, but let’s consider another case.
You may love your parents, your parents love their parents, and you love
your grandparents. So this is a case where we have <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} z\)</span>. But obviously love is
not a transitive relation — it is perfectly possible for a person you
love to love somebody that you do not love at all. This shows that a
relation is transitive only if there isn’t even a single counterexample
to transitivity.</p>
</div>
<p>Intuitively, transitivity tells us that whatever can be reached in
two steps can be reached in one step. But this actually implies that
anything that can be reached in a finite number of steps can be reached
in one step. This follows by iterated invocation of transitivity.
Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b \mathrel{R} c\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(c \mathrel{R} d\)</span>. This is shown
pictorially below.</p>
<p><img src="transitivity1.svg" alt="transitivity1.svg" /></p>
<p>Then by transitivity, we also have <span class="math inline">\(a
\mathrel{R} c\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="transitivity2.svg" alt="transitivity2.svg" /></p>
<p>But then, again by transitivity, we must also have <span
class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} d\)</span> because of <span
class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} c\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c \mathrel{R} d\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="transitivity3.svg" alt="transitivity3.svg" /></p>
<p>Since we can apply the same argument over and over again, anything
that can be reached with a finite number of steps can also be reached in
a single step.</p>
<p>It is also important to keep in mind that some relations can be
trivially transitive, such as the relation below. Here there are no
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> such that we have both <span
class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} b\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b \mathrel{R} c\)</span>, so transitivity holds
because we cannot produce any counterexample to the claim that the
relation is transitive.</p>
<p><img src="transitivity_trivial.svg"
alt="transitivity_trivial.svg" /></p>
<p>Nor does transitivity imply that we can reach every element from
every other element with a single step. Nodes may still be unreachable
from certain positions. In the natural numbers, for example, <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> is transitive, yet it does not allow
us to reach <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(8\)</span> (only the other way round).</p>
<h2 id="irreflexivity">Irreflexivity</h2>
<p>Irreflexivity is much easier to understand than transitivity as it
simply requires that no element be related to itself. In pictorial
terms, an element is related to itself if there is a loop from the
corresponding node back to itself. Only if there isn’t a single node
with such a loop is the relation <strong>irreflexive</strong>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be a binary relation over
<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is <strong>irreflexive</strong> iff
there is no <span class="math inline">\(x \in D\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} x\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The human parent-of relation is irreflexive because nobody can be
their own parent. Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>
over natural numbers is irreflexive because no number can be strictly
less than itself. However, <span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> is
not irreflexive because <span class="math inline">\(x \leq x\)</span>
for every number <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Another
relation that is not irreflexive is the relation induced by the identity
function <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{id}\)</span>, which maps
every element to itself. This is shown below for the set <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ 1,2,3,4 \right \}\)</span> with the
identity relation:</p>
<p><img src="1234.svg" alt="1234.svg" /></p>
</div>
<p>Note that pictures can sometimes be misleading when it comes to
irreflexivity. Consider the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="irreflexivity_violated.svg"
alt="irreflexivity_violated.svg" /></p>
<p>It looks like this relation is irreflexive because no node has a loop
back to itself. But it is common style for such figures to omit all
connections that can be inferred via transitivity. So if this figure
actually depicts a transitivity relation, then <span
class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} b\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b \mathrel{R} a\)</span> implies <span
class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} a\)</span> because of transitivity.
A clear violation of irreflexivity.</p>
<h2 id="asymmetry">Asymmetry</h2>
<p>A relation is asymmetric iff two elements can only be related in one
direction, not both.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be a binary relation over
<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is <strong>asymmetric</strong> iff it
holds for all <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} y\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(y
\not\mathrel{R} x\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The human parent-of relation is asymmetric. If John is a parent of
Mary, then Mary cannot be a parent of John — assuming that there are no
time travel shenanigans.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The brother-of relation is not asymmetric. Yes, John may be a brother
of Mary yet Mary isn’t a brother of John, which satisfies the asymmetry
requirement. But we have to look at all relevant cases. There is at
least one John out there who is a brother of a male human, who in turn
would be the brother of John. Asymmetry is violated.</p>
</div>
<p>As with irreflexivity, some transitive relations may not be
asymmetric even though they look like it.</p>
<p><img src="asymmetry_violated.svg" alt="asymmetry_violated.svg" /></p>
<p>It looks like the figure above contains no two nodes <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R}
x\)</span> both hold. But once again the figure might just omit the
parts of the relation that can be inferred from transitivity. If so,
then <span class="math inline">\(b \mathrel{R} c\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(c \mathrel{R} d\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(d \mathrel{R} a\)</span> jointly imply <span
class="math inline">\(b \mathrel{R} a\)</span>. But we already have
<span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} b\)</span>, so asymmetry is
violated.</p>
<h2 id="semiconnexity">Semiconnexity</h2>
<p>A relation is <strong>semiconnex</strong> iff all elements of the set
are related to each other. Pictorially, there has to be some line
between any two given nodes ( the lines that can be inferred via
transitivity).</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> over set
<span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is <strong>semiconnex</strong>
iff <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span> holds for all <span
class="math inline">\(x, y \in D\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>This unit contains several relations that are semiconnex. They are
repeated below (but for the sake of readability, all edges are omitted
that can be inferred from transitivity).</p>
<p><img src="transitivity1.svg" alt="transitivity1.svg" /></p>
<p><img src="irreflexivity_violated.svg"
alt="irreflexivity_violated.svg" /></p>
<p><img src="asymmetry_violated.svg" alt="asymmetry_violated.svg" /></p>
<p>However, one of the displayed relations is not semiconnex.</p>
<p><img src="transitivity_trivial.svg"
alt="transitivity_trivial.svg" /></p>
<p>That’s because <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> are distinct, yet neither <span
class="math inline">\(a_1 \mathrel{R} b_1\)</span> nor <span
class="math inline">\(b_1 \mathrel{R} a_1\)</span> hold.</p>
<p>The previous unit also showed a relation that’s not semiconnex.</p>
<p><img src="natnum_digitsum.svg" alt="natnum_digitsum.svg" /></p>
<p>Here none of the elements in the same “column” are related to each
other, violating semiconnexity.</p>
