</div>
<p>There are numerous types of order relations, but arguably the most
common one is <strong>partial orders</strong>. Intuitively, a partial
order is a linear order (also called total order) where we have removed
some orderings between elements. Formally, though, things are defined
exactly the other way round: linear orders are a special case of partial
orders. Hence we will first define partial orders before turning to
linear orders in the next unit.</p>
<h2 id="definition-of-partial-orders">Definition of partial orders</h2>
<p>Partial orders can be defined very succinctly, but doing so requires
specialized vocabulary.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <strong>partial order</strong> is a binary relation <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> that is</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>transitive</strong>: for all <span class="math inline">\(x,
y, z\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span> jointly imply <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} z\)</span>, and</li>
<li><strong>antisymmetric</strong>: for all <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, if <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} y\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R}
x\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span>, and</li>
<li>either <strong>reflexive</strong> or <strong>irreflexive</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>reflexive</strong>: for all <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, it holds that <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} x\)</span>,</li>
<li><strong>irreflexive</strong>: there is no <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} x\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If the partial order is reflexive, it is a <strong>weak partial
order</strong>. If it is irreflexive, it is a <strong>strict partial
order</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>This is a very abstract definition. In order to truly understand it,
you have to develop an intuitive grasp of what each property means.</p>
<h2 id="transitivity">Transitivity</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, transitivity says “Whatever you can reach in two
steps, you can reach in one step”.</p>
<p>Suppose you have some set <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> of
objects with a binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>
defined over them. For example, we may have the set of natural numbers
(0, 1, 2, ) with the <em>strictly less than</em> relation <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, where we have <span
class="math inline">\(3 &lt; 5\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(4 &lt; 5\)</span>, but not <span
class="math inline">\(5 &lt; 5\)</span> (although <span
class="math inline">\(5 \leq 5\)</span>). We can think of these as
structures where the set specifies the collection of building blocks and
the relation connects these building blocks, putting them into a
particular structural configuration. We can move through <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> along <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>: if we are at <span
class="math inline">\(x \in D\)</span>, we can move to any <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} y\)</span>. And from <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>,
we can move on to any <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span>, and so on.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>From the natural number <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span>, we
can move to <span class="math inline">\(17\)</span> via <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, and from there to <span
class="math inline">\(329\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>This movement metaphor is useful for understanding transitivity and
other properties of relations. Some relations are such that whatever can
be reached in two steps can also be reached in one step. So <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span> entail that we also have
<span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} z\)</span> — the ability to
move from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> via <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> implies that we can move directly from
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> without a stop at <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. This is what it means for a relation
to be <strong>transitive</strong>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is <strong>transitive</strong> iff for
all <span class="math inline">\(x,y,z \in D\)</span> it holds that <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span> jointly imply <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} z\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The human ancestor relation <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is
transitive. Your mother is one of your ancestors, and every ancestor of
your mother is an ancestor of yourself. So <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{A} y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{A}
z\)</span> imply <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{A}
z\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The human parent-of relation is not transitive. There can be <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is the parent of <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>
is the parent of <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, but <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is not the parent of <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. In fact, that is how things are
supposed to go in the real world and every deviation from this case is
very problematic.</p>
</div>
<p>Crucially, for a relation to be transitive it is not enough to have
some case where <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span> jointly imply <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} z\)</span>. This has to hold in all
cases, including those where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> are not necessarily all distinct.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the sibling relation <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.
There certainly are instances of transitivity. If John is a sibling of
Mary and Mary is a sibling of Sue, then John is a sibling of Sue.
However, even though John is a sibling of Mary and Mary is a sibling of
John, John is not his own sibling. In formal terms, we have <span
class="math inline">\(\text{John} \mathrel{S} \text{Mary}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(\text{Mary} \mathrel{S}
\text{John}\)</span>, yet <span class="math inline">\(\text{John}
\not\mathrel{S} \text{John}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Let’s consider one more example of a relation that may look
transitive but is not. You may love your parents, your parents love
their parents, and you love your grandparents. So this is a case where
we have <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} z\)</span>. But this does not make
love a transitive relation — it is perfectly possible for a person you
love to love somebody that you do not love at all.</p>
</div>
<p>The examples above show that a relation is transitive only if there
isn’t even a single counterexample to transitivity. If there is even one
choice of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{R} y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R}
z\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(x \not\mathrel{R}
z\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> is not
transitive.</p>
<p>Intuitively, transitivity tells us that whatever can be reached in
two steps can be reached in one step. But this actually implies that
anything that can be reached in a finite number of steps can be reached
in one step. This follows by iterated invocation of transitivity.
Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} b\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b \mathrel{R} c\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(c \mathrel{R} d\)</span>. This is shown
pictorially below.</p>
<p><img src="transitivity1.svg" alt="transitivity1.svg" /></p>
<p>Then by transitivity, we also have <span class="math inline">\(a
\mathrel{R} c\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="transitivity2.svg" alt="transitivity2.svg" /></p>
<p>But then, again by transitivity, we must also have <span
class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} d\)</span> because of <span
class="math inline">\(a \mathrel{R} c\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c \mathrel{R} d\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="transitivity3.svg" alt="transitivity3.svg" /></p>
<p>Since we can apply the same argument over and over again, anything
that can be reached with a finite number of steps can also be reached in
a single step.</p>
<p>It is also important to keep in mind that some relations can be
trivially transitive. Transitivity can be violated only if there are
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> such that both <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span> hold. If that is not the
case, the relation is trivially transitive because there is no
configuration where it violates transitivity.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the relation with <span class="math inline">\(a_1
\mathrel{R} a_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b_1 \mathrel{R}
b_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c_1 \mathrel{R} c_2\)</span>,
and <span class="math inline">\(d_1 \mathrel{R} d_2\)</span>. It is also
depicted below.</p>
<p><img src="transitivity_trivial.svg"
alt="transitivity_trivial.svg" /></p>
<p>Here there is no way of choosing <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> such that we have both <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} z\)</span>. Consequently,
transitivity holds because we cannot produce any counterexample to the
claim that the relation is transitive.</p>
</div>
<p>Transitivity also does not imply that we every element is reachable
from any other element in a single step. Nodes may still be unreachable
from certain positions.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>In the example above, there is no way at all to move from <span
class="math inline">\(a_2\)</span> to any other element.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The relation <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> over natural
numbers is transitive. Yet it does not follow that <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span> can be reached from <span
class="math inline">\(8\)</span>, only the opposite holds: <span
class="math inline">\(8\)</span> can be reached from <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Consider the relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> over
natural numbers such that <span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{\sim}

class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is odd. Is this relation transitive?
Justify your answer.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="antisymmetry">Antisymmetry</h2>
<p>Antisymmetry can be thought of in two different ways that build on
the metaphor of relations as adding arrows to the elements of a set:</p>
<ul>
<li>“If the order relation has any loops at all, those must be
self-loops.”</li>
<li>“If <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are distinct, then they cannot be
mutually related.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Here a loop is a sequence of arrows that leads from an element back
to itself. A self-loop is the special case of a loop where there is a
single arrow that directly goes from the element back to itself. And
“mutually related” means that there are arrows from one element to the
other and the other way round.</p>
<p>These are intuitive interpretations of two equivalents definition of
antisymmetry.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>A binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is <strong>antisymmetric</strong> iff
<span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span> jointly imply <span
class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(x, y \in D\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p>A binary relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is <strong>antisymmetric</strong> iff
it holds for all <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in D\)</span> that
<span class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span> implies <span
class="math inline">\(x \not\mathrel{R} y\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(y \not\mathrel{R} x\)</span> (or both).</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider again the set of natural numbers with the relation <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, which is antisymmetric. Let us see
how this follows from the first definition.</p>
<p>There are no natural numbers <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x &lt; y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y &lt; x\)</span> both hold. But then <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> is trivially antisymmetric. This is
because the only way a relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>
can fail to be antisymmetric is if there is a counterexample to
antisymmetry. A counterexample would require <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span>, and</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span>, and</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>But if we cannot even find any <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y \mathrel{R} x\)</span>, then clearly there is no
such counterexample.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Let us look one more time at the natural numbers with <span

second definition. It requires that <span class="math inline">\(x \neq

y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y \not\mathrel{R} x\)</span>
(or both). But this is obviously the case for <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>. For instance, <span

<h2 id="irreflexivity">(Ir)Reflexivity</h2>
<p>Reflexivity and irreflexivity are much easier to understand that
transitivity and, in particular, antisymmetry. Intuitively, they are
statements about the presence of self-loops.</p>
<ol type="1">

because <span class="math inline">\(x \leq x\)</span> for every number
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Another reflexive relation is the relation induced by the identity
function <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{id}\)</span>, which maps
every element to itself. This is shown below for the set <span

<p>Note that pictures can sometimes be misleading when it comes to
(ir)reflexivity. Consider the figure below.</p>
<p><img src="irreflexivity_violated.svg"
alt="irreflexivity_violated.svg" /></p>
<p>Here we have two elements <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> with an arrow from <span

class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and another from <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. It looks like this relation is
irreflexive because no element has a self-loop. But it is common style
for such figures to omit all connections that can be inferred via
transitivity. So if this figure actually depicts a transitivity

entail <span class="math inline">\(b \mathrel{R} b\)</span>, rendering

<ul>
<li>Partial orders allow some elements to be unordered with respect to
each other, but it is not a case of anything goes. Very specific
properties must be met in order for a binary relation to be a partial
order.</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p>A <strong>partial order</strong> is a binary relation <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> that is transitive, antisymmetric, and
either reflexive or irreflexive. If the partial order is reflexive, it
is a <strong>weak partial order</strong>. If it is irreflexive, it is a
<strong>strict partial order</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Strict partial orders are sometimes defined as binary relations that
are transitive and asymmetric. This definition is equivalent to the one
above.</li>
