<p>Sets can be compared based on how many elements they contain.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The set <span class="math inline">\(A \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{
a,b,c \right \}\)</span> contains exactly as many elements as the set
<span class="math inline">\(X \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ x,y,z \right
\}\)</span>, namely <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. Each set has
fewer members than <span class="math inline">\(A \cup X\)</span>, which
contains <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> elements, whereas <span
class="math inline">\(A \cap X\)</span> has <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> members.</p>
</div>
<p>This is commonly called the <strong>size</strong> of a set, but the
more accurate term is <strong>cardinality</strong>. The cardinality of a
set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is denoted <span
class="math inline">\(\left | A \right |\)</span>.</p>
<p>Often we do not care about the exact value of <span
class="math inline">\(\left | A \right |\)</span> but rather how it
compares to <span class="math inline">\(\left | B \right |\)</span> for
some other set <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. In such cases it
isn’t always practical to simply count how many members each set has
(the sets may be very large, or perhaps even infinite). Instead, one can
use functions to compare the cardinality of sets. We say that <span
class="math inline">\(\left | A \right | \leq B\)</span> iff there is a
(total) function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> such that every
element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is mapped to some
element of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and every element of
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has at most one element of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> mapped to it. The second half of that
clause means that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> must be
<strong>injective</strong> (or equivalently,
<strong>one-to-one</strong>): if <span class="math inline">\(x \neq
y\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \neq
f(y)\)</span>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(A \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left
\{ a,b,c \right \}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ d,e,f,g \right \}\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(\left | A \right | \leq \left | D \right
|\)</span>, as every element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
can be mapped to some distinct element of <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. For instance, we could have a function
with <span class="math inline">\(a \mapsto f\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b \mapsto d\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(c \mapsto g\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the other direction, <span class="math inline">\(\left | D \right
| \not\leq \left | A \right |\)</span>. No matter how one maps the
elements of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> to members of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, at least two members of <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> will have to be mapped to the same
element in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(\left | \left \{ 3, \emptyset,
3 \right \} \right | \leq \left | \left \{ \mathit{John}, \mathit{Mary},
\emptyset \right \} \right |\)</span> by giving a function that maps
every element of the former set to some member of the latter.</p>
</div>
<p>Given the definition above, we have <span class="math inline">\(\left
| A \right | = \left | B \right |\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(\left | A \right | \leq \left | B \right
|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left | B \right | \leq \left
| A \right |\)</span> are both true. But this means we would have to
specify two separate functions, one from <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and one from <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. There is a more direct definition that
does this with just one function. First, a (total) function <span
class="math inline">\(f: A \rightarrow B\)</span> is a
<strong>bijection</strong> or <strong>one-to-one correspondence</strong>
iff it is injective and for every <span class="math inline">\(b \in
B\)</span> there is some <span class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span>
such that <span class="math inline">\(f(a) = b\)</span> (we also say
that the function is <strong>surjective</strong> or
<strong>onto</strong>). In other words, <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> maps every element of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to some element of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and every element of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has exactly one element of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> mapped to it. Then <span
class="math inline">\(\left | A \right | = \left | B \right |\)</span>
iff there is a bijection <span class="math inline">\(f: A \rightarrow
B\)</span>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>We already saw that <span class="math inline">\(\left | A \right | =
\left | X \right |\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(A
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ a,b,c \right \}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(X \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ x,y,z \right
\}\)</span>. A possible choice of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>
would be <span class="math inline">\(a \mapsto x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b \mapsto y\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(c \mapsto z\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The sets <span class="math inline">\(A \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{
0,1,2 \right \}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ 2,3 \right \}\)</span> obviously have
distinct cardinality. The set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
contains 3 elements, the set <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> only
2. But let us see how we get the same result via our mathematical
definition.</p>
<p>Suppose we have some arbitrary function <span
class="math inline">\(f: A \rightarrow B\)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a bijection, then it must map every
element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to some element of
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. But since there are three
elements in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and only two in <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, some element of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> must be the output for at least two
elements of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. But then <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not a bijection.</p>
<p>In the other direction, consider some arbitrary function <span
class="math inline">\(g: B \rightarrow A\)</span>. Since a function maps
each input to at most one output, the two elements of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are mapped to at most two elements of
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. But <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has three elements, so one element of
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> cannot be an output for any
element of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Again we find that
<span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> cannot be bijection.</p>
<p>This exhausts all cases we need to consider, and we may conclude that
no function from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, or the other way round, can be a
bijection. Hence <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> must have distinct cardinality.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Show that Let <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> be the set of
all odd natural numbers that are at least <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and at most <span
class="math inline">\(9\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> the set of all even natural numbers
that are at least <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and at most
<span class="math inline">\(9\)</span>. Show that <span
class="math inline">\(\left | O \right | = \left | E \right
|\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>For finite sets, our intuitive notion of size closely matches the
technical term of cardinality. However, size and cardinality diverge
once we look at infinite sets.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ 0,1,2,\ldots \right \}\)</span> of all
natural numbers and the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}_+
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ 1,2,\ldots \right \}\)</span> of all
positive natural numbers. Intuitively, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> is larger than <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}_+\)</span> because it contains all
members of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}_+\)</span> as well as
0, which is not in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}_+\)</span>.
But the function <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow
\mathbb{N}_+\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n \mapsto
n+1\)</span> is a bijection. It maps <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>
to <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, and so on, so that every
natural number is mapped to a positive natural number, and every
positive natural number has some natural number mapped to it. Hence
<span class="math inline">\(\left | \mathbb{N} \right | = \left |
\mathbb{N}_+ \right |\)</span> even though intuitively the two sets have
distinct size.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Show that the set of natural numbers has the same cardinality as the
set of all even natural numbers.</p>
</div>
<p>In a later chapter, we will see that our definition of cardinality
entails that there are different “sizes” of infinity, and that we want
one specific infinity size to talk about language.</p>

<ul>
<li>Instead of the intuitive notion of size, we use the formal notion of
<strong>cardinality</strong> to measure how many elements a set
contains.</li>
<li>For every finite set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, its
cardinality <span class="math inline">\(\left | A \right |\)</span> is
the number of elements it contains.</li>
<li>We can use functions to measure the relative cardinality of distinct
sets <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left | A \right | \leq \left | B \right
|\)</span>: there exists a total, injective function <span
class="math inline">\(f: A \rightarrow B\)</span> (where <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is <strong>injective</strong> iff <span
class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span> implies <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) \neq f(y)\)</span>).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left | A \right | \geq \left | B \right
|\)</span>: there exists a total, surjective function <span
class="math inline">\(f: A \rightarrow B\)</span> (where <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is <strong>surjective</strong> iff for
every <span class="math inline">\(b \in B\)</span> there is some <span
class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(f(a) = b\)</span>).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left | A \right | = \left | B \right
|\)</span>: there exists a bijection <span class="math inline">\(f: A
\rightarrow B\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is
a <strong>bijection</strong> iff it is both injective and
surjective).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When the name of function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is
clear from context, one may write <span class="math inline">\(x \mapsto
y\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(f(x) =
y\)</span>.</li>
<li>While cardinality is very intuitive for finite sets, it yields
surprising results with infinite sets.</li>
