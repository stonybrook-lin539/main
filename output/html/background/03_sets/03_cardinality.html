<p>Sets can be compared based on how many elements they contain.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The set <span class="math inline">\(A \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{
a,b,c \right \}\)</span> contains exactly as many elements as the set
<span class="math inline">\(X \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ x,y,z \right
\}\)</span>, namely <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. Each set has
fewer members than <span class="math inline">\(A \cup X\)</span>, which
contains <span class="math inline">\(6\)</span> elements, whereas <span
class="math inline">\(A \cap X\)</span> has <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> members.</p>
</div>
<p>This is commonly called the <strong>size</strong> of a set, but the
more accurate term is <strong>cardinality</strong>. The cardinality of a
set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is denoted <span
class="math inline">\(\left | A \right |\)</span>. We say that <span
class="math inline">\(\left | A \right | \leq B\)</span> iff there is a
function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> such that every element
of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is mapped to some element of
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and every element of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has at most one element of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> mapped to it.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(A \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left
\{ a,b,c \right \}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(D
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ d,e,f,g \right \}\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(\left | A \right | \leq \left | D \right
|\)</span>, as every element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
can be mapped to some distinct element of <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. For instance, we could have a function
with <span class="math inline">\(a \mapsto f\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b \mapsto d\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(c \mapsto g\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the other direction, <span class="math inline">\(\left | D \right
| \not\leq \left | A \right |\)</span>. No matter how one maps the
elements of <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> to members of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, at least two members of <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> will have to be mapped to the same
element in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Clearly <span class="math inline">\(\left | A \right | = \left | B
\right |\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(\left | A \right |
\leq \left | B \right |\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left |
B \right | \leq \left | A \right |\)</span> are both true. But there is
a more direct definition: <span class="math inline">\(\left | A \right |
= \left | B \right |\)</span> iff there is a function <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> maps every element of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to some element of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and every element of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has exactly one element of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> mapped to it. We also say that there is
a <strong>bijection</strong> between <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, which is a technical term for a 1-to-1
correspondence between the elements of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>We already saw that <span class="math inline">\(\left | A \right | =
\left | X \right |\)</span> in the previous example. A possible choice
of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> would be <span
class="math inline">\(a \mapsto x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b \mapsto y\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(c \mapsto z\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The sets <span class="math inline">\(A \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{
0,1,2 \right \}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ 2,3 \right \}\)</span> obviously have
distinct cardinality. The set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
contains 3 elements, the set <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> only
2. But let us see how we get the same result via our mathematical
definition.</p>
<p>Suppose we have some arbitrary function <span
class="math inline">\(f: A \rightarrow B\)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a bijection, then it must map every
element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to some element of
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. But since there are three
elements in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and only two in <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, some element of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> must be the output for at least two
elements of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. But then <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not a bijection.</p>
<p>In the other direction, consider some arbitrary function <span
class="math inline">\(g: B \rightarrow A\)</span>. Since a function maps
each input to at most one output, the two elements of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are mapped to at most two elements of
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. But <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has three elements, so one element of
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> cannot be an output for any
element of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Again we find that
<span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> cannot be bijection.</p>
<p>This exhausts all cases we need to consider, and we may conclude that
no function from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, or the other way round, can be a
bijection. Hence <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> must have distinct cardinality.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(\left | \left \{  0 \leq n &lt;
10 \mid n \text{ is odd} \right \} = \left | \left \{  0 \leq n &lt; 10
\mid n \text{ is even} \right \} \right | \right |\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>For finite sets, our intuitive notion of size closely matches the
technical term of cardinality. However, size and cardinality diverge
once we look at infinite sets.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ 0,1,2,\ldots \right \}\)</span> of all
natural numbers and the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}_+
\mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{ 1,2,\ldots \right \}\)</span> of all
positive natural numbers. Intuitively, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> is larger than <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}_+\)</span> because it contains all
members of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}_+\)</span> as well as
0, which is not in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}_+\)</span>.
But the function <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow
\mathbb{N}_+\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n \mapsto
n+1\)</span> is a bijection. Hence <span class="math inline">\(\left |
\mathbb{N} \right | = \left | \mathbb{N}_+ \right |\)</span> even though
intuitively the two sets have distinct size.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Show that the set of natural numbers has the same cardinality as the
set of all even natural numbers.</p>
</div>
<p>In a later unit, we will see that our definition of cardinality
entails that there are different “sizes” of infinity, and that we want
one specific infinity size to talk about language.</p>
