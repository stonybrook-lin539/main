<h1 id="mathematical-elegance">Mathematical elegance</h1>
<p>Mathematics is a very elegant enterprise, but it takes some expertise
to appreciate that elegance. Just like a glass of premium whiskey,
mathematics may be overwhelming and downright unpleasant to the
uninitiated. This is particularly true for one trait of mathematics:
minimalism. Mathematicians do not like to introduce completely new
primitives, instead everything is built from a minimal set of building
blocks.</p>
<p>For a concrete example of a system that would not please
mathematicians, consider the Roman number system. It starts out very
promising, as 1 is I, 2 is II, and 3 III. This would allow us to give a
nice, compact definition of the possible numbers.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>The recursive Roman number system (RR) is defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>I is a number.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a number, then so is
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>I.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The definition tells us that all of the following are numbers in the
RR-system: I, II, III, IIII, and all other sequences of the letter I,
e.g. IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII. So the number 4 would be represented as IIII, 7
as IIIIIII, and so on. Of course that would make it very cumbersome to
write down a number like 217, and there would be no practical way to
write down a number like 5 trillion trillion.</p>
<p>But as you probably know, this is not how the Roman number system
actually works. After III we get IV, not IIII (except on clocks, there
you sometimes see IIII for some strange reason). The number 5 is V, not
IIIII (even on clocks). And 10 is X, 50 is L, 100 is C, 500 is D, and
1000 is M. These symbols are combined in complex ways to represent
specific numbers. For instance, we have XLVI for 46, MMCDXXXVIII for
2438, and MCMXCIX for 1999.</p>
<p>Many non-mathematicians like the idea of giving numbers like 5, 10,
50, and 100 special symbols because they feel more important and
relevant to us. For some reason they are intuitively more pleasing than
23 or 77. They also turn up more often in daily life — just think of the
values on dollar bills. So it is more convenient to use, say, V instead
of IIIII. And while we still cannot write 5 trillion trillion in an easy
way, your average Joe or Jane Doe doesn’t really need that, and at least
217 is now simply CCXVII instead of 217 Is in row. Therefore the average
person who just wants to easily work with numbers that are relatively
small but still larger than 10 may prefer the standard Roman system
rather than our RR concoction.</p>
<p>A mathematician, however, is not interested in a system that is easy
to use in daily life. Mathematicians want a system that is easy to
reason about. The Roman system is pretty obtuse in that respect. We no
longer have I as our only primitive building block, instead there are
also V, X, L, C, D, and M. And the way these numbers can be combined is
much more complicated. Whereas the RR-system allows any arbitrary
combination of Is, the Roman system has a more complicated combinatorial
system. For example, CLL is not a well-formed Roman number, nor are CMC
and IVX. Go ahead, do some research, then try to write down the
combinatorial rules of the Roman number system — you will need a much
more elaborate definition.</p>
<p>But obviously both systems can represent exactly the same numbers.
There is no magical number that can be represented in the standard Roman
system not in the RR-system. This is why a mathematician would prefer
the simpler RR-system. It makes it much easier to prove essential
results. Once the RR-system is better understood, one extends the
results to the Roman number system by defining a mechanism for
converting from one number system to the other.</p>
<p>The example above is slightly silly because mathematicians have more
abstract ways of talking about numbers, ways where it no longer matters
how numbers are actually written. But the general principle is very
close to mathematical practice and will be with us for the entirety of
this course:</p>
<div class="advice">
<ul>
<li>Study simple systems.</li>
<li>Reduce complex systems to simple systems.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose we are studying the set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> of <strong>integers</strong>,
which contains <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(-2\)</span>, and so on. We want to know what kind
of mathematical system we get if we allow addition and subtraction of
integers. What are the properties of this system? Well, the first thing
we can say is that subtraction is a redundant operation because <span
class="math inline">\(m - n = m + (-n)\)</span>. For instance, <span
class="math inline">\(5 - 3 = 2 = 5 + (-3)\)</span>. So instead of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(+\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(-\)</span>, we can focus on the simpler system
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(+\)</span> only. That will make our life quite a
bit easier because there’s only one operation to worry about instead of
two.</p>
