<h1 id="reading-mathematics">Reading mathematics</h1>
<p>While these materials are designed to be as approachable as possible,
a certain mathematical style of writing will be indispensable. This
includes special notation, some math-specific jargon, and even a
particular way of interpreting English sentences. Mathematicians do not
do this to sound smarter than they are or to isolate themselves from the
uninformed layman, but because it makes it easier for them to
communicate their ideas. This is no different from any other field of
research — a specialized field of study requires a specialized means of
communication. It will take you a while to get used to this way of
talking and writing, but here are a few tips to make sure you don’t
throw in the towel too early.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-symbol-shock">Dealing with symbol shock</h2>
<p>The most salient aspect of mathematical communication is the heavy
reliance on special symbols. This starts with formulas like <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) = kx + d\)</span> and quickly develops into
complex statements such as the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span> be a totally
ordered collection of languages <span class="math inline">\(L_1, \ldots,
L_n\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1\)</span>) such that
for all <span class="math inline">\(1 \leq i,j \leq n\)</span> we have
<span class="math inline">\(L_j \not\subseteq L_i\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(i &lt; j\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>For any given string <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and
PCFG <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, the probability of <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{d
\in D_G(s)} \prod_{r \in d} p_G(r)\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(D_G(s)\)</span> is the set of derivation trees of
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> that yield <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>
is a tree bigram of a derivation tree, and <span
class="math inline">\(p_G(r)\)</span> is the probability of <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> according to <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A <em><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-interval</em>, or
simply <em><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-val</em>, is a <span
class="math inline">\(5\)</span>-tuple <span class="math inline">\(\left
\langle k,G_l, G_r, G_o, G_f \right \rangle\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(k \geq 1\)</span> and each <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is an SL-<span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> grammar that specifies, respectively,
the left edge, right edge, open slots, and the fillers. The
corresponding <em><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-val
formula</em> (with free variables <span
class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\ldots\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(x_k\)</span>) is <span
class="math display">\[\begin{multline*}
    \exists l,r
    \bigg [
        \bigwedge_{g \in G_l} \neg g(l)
        \wedge
        \bigwedge_{g \in G_r} \neg g(r)
        \wedge
        \bigwedge_{1 \leq i \leq k}
        \bigwedge_{g \in G_o} \neg g(x_i)
        \wedge
        l \prec x_1
        \wedge
        x_k \prec r
        \wedge
        \\
        \forall z
        \Big [
            \big (
                (l \prec z \wedge z \prec x_1)
                \vee
                (x_k \prec z \wedge z \prec r)
                \vee
                \bigvee_{1 \leq i &lt; k}
                (x_i \prec z \wedge z \prec x_{i+1})
            \big )
            \rightarrow
            \bigwedge_{g \in G_f} \neg g(z)
        \Big ]
    \bigg ]
\end{multline*}\]</span> For any empty <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\bigwedge_{g \in G} \neg g(x)\)</span> is always
satisfied.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Unless you’ve had previous mathematical training, these passages
probably made your eyes glaze over and your brain freeze in horror:
“What is this stuff? What’s <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>
again, why is there a big sigma, and what is the subscript there? Why
can’t they just say what they mean in plain English? I can’t understand
this, it’s hopeless, I’m just not made for math.” Don’t despair, you’ve
just experienced <em>symbol shock</em>.</p>
<p>Symbol shock refers to the phenomenon that just looking at a page of
math can be so disheartening that you can’t think clearly. It’s like
being at the base of Mount Everest, looking up, and feeling that you’ll
never be able to reach the top. So rather than trying you give up
immediately, or you overcompensate and rush forward in a frenzy without
paying attention to what you’re doing. Neither approach will get you to
the goal. In order to deal with symbol shock, you have to develop the
central survival skills of mathematics: take your time, and keep a cool
head.</p>
<p>You cannot read math like a novel or even your average textbook. An 8
page paper can easily keep you busy for days before you fully understand
it. Revolutionary proofs may only span a few pages yet take trained
mathematicians months to understand. Math takes time, so do not rush. As
soon as you internalize this simple rule, symbol shock will be much less
of a problem. When a new symbol is introduced, pause and commit it to
memory. When you see a complex formula, work through it symbol by symbol
until you understand what’s going on here. Just. Take. Your. Time.</p>
<p>This is actually why I think that math is easier to learn from a book
than a class. With a text, you can reread every sentence until you get
it. You can go back 3 pages to revisit a point you thought was clear to
you but now seems to be at odds with what you’re reading. You can’t do
that in a lecture. But you actually have to do all those things, you
have to slow down, go back, reread. Math isn’t all that hard, but you
have to be very disciplined about it.</p>
<p>With time, you will get much better at reading math and it will take
you much less effort, but for the beginning I suggest that you do the
following to better deal with symbol shock:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assign colors to specific symbols and types of objects. In my
personal experience, I can tell pretty easily how well I understand a
paper based on how I would color its math. At first, it’s all just
black, but as I get a deeper understanding of the objects and how they
hang together I construct an internal coloring system for myself. So
grammars are blue, automata green, certain variables that keep
reoccurring are purple and teal, and so on. If you use the pdf versions
of the units, you can literally add colors to all the symbols, and that
way the logic of the pages will reveal itself more clearly to
you.</p></li>
<li><p>Think about <strong>why</strong> certain symbols were chosen.
Mathematicians care a great deal about good notation, and it really
shows. A math paper with a well-designed notation is a pleasure to read.
There’s certain established conventions. For instance, indices are
usually chosen to be <span class="math inline">\(i, j, k\)</span>,
variables are <span class="math inline">\(x, y, z\)</span>, and
functions are <span class="math inline">\(f, g, h\)</span>. But that’s
just a rule of thumb. A labeling function may be <span
class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>, which looks like an <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> but is slightly different so that <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> can be used to refer to labels instead.
Never try to memorize notation in a brute-force manner, try to
understand the design principles behind it. If you know why the notation
looks the way it does, you’ll have a much easier time remembering even
minor details and nuances.</p></li>
<li><p>Set yourself realistic goals. Don’t attempt to read 20 pages in
one sitting. Instead, plan for 3 or 4 reading sessions of 5 pages each.
And go in with the expectation that you will have to read some passages
multiple times, and that you’ll have to go back a few pages to look up
some symbol or definition.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t give up. None of the things we cover are some
super-advanced hardcore math problems that will make your head explode
unless you have an IQ of 150. What we are doing is the math-equivalent
of running a 5k: most college students aren’t fit enough to do it on
their first try, but they can reach that level with a few months of
training. It requires tenacity and discipline, though.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dealing-with-some-other-stumbling-blocks">Dealing with some
other stumbling blocks</h2>
<h3 id="no-implicatures">No implicatures</h3>
<p>Mathematical writing is also peculiar because, as we linguists like
to say, implicatures are often cancelled implicitly. That’s a smarty
pants way of saying that only the literal meaning is the intended one.
So the phrase “Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be a set
containing two odd numbers” does not entail that <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> only contains two odd numbers. It could
contain all kinds of additional things, including other odd numbers, but
at the very least it contains two odd numbers. If we wanted the set to
contain two odd numbers and nothing else, we would have written “Let
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be a set containing exactly two
odd numbers, and nothing else”. Tricky, hmm? For the uninitiated reader,
it is easy to miss something important by assuming that the statement is
more specific than it actually is.</p>
<p>Another common pitfall arises with statements like “Every blue dragon
is a chain smoker”. Is this claim true or false? A linguist will tell
you that it is neither, and instead contains a presupposition violation
(yes, linguists like their fancy terms, too) because the sentence
assumes that blue dragons exist, which they obviously do not. A
mathematician doesn’t care for such linguistic subtleties and instead
considers the statement true because there exists no blue dragon that
isn’t a chain smoker. That is perfectly fine for mathematics, but it’s
very different from how a layperson would interpret the sentence. Again,
when dealing with math you shouldn’t assume anything that isn’t stated
explicitly.</p>
<p>Quite generally, you should try to identify minimal examples: when
you see a statement or definition, always think about the simplest
object that satisfies it, and ask yourself how much this object can
change before it no longer fits the description.</p>
<h3 id="questioning-definitions">Questioning definitions</h3>
<p>Speaking of definitions, you should always ask yourself why something
is defined the way it is. I don’t mean this in some kind of
existentialist way like “What does it mean to be red?”, but a
utilitarian one: considering that we could have defined something in a
million slightly different ways, what might be the reason that makes
this the most useful, elegant or productive definition? Remember,
definitions can’t be true or false, they can only be useful or useless.
So what is it that makes a given definition useful? In exploring this
question, you will get a much better understanding of what the
definition even defines, and that is key to studying the kind of object
that is being defined.</p>
<h3 id="making-definitions-concrete">Making definitions concrete</h3>
<p>Another helpful strategy in dealing with definitions is to come up
with two distinct lists: examples that fit the definition, and examples
that do not fit the definition. Both are equally important. Sometimes a
definition may be so abstract and general that it is hard to see what
would not fit the definition. In seeking out those examples, you gain a
much better idea of the defined class of objects.</p>
<p>To give just one example, an <em>algebra</em> is a set <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with a function <span
class="math inline">\(+\)</span> that takes elements of <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> as input and produces elements of <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> as its output. We also say that <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is <em>closed under <span
class="math inline">\(+\)</span></em>. That is a very general
definition, and one can immediately think of tons of algebras:</p>
<ul>
<li>the natural numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, …) with addition: you take two
natural numbers, add them together, and you still have a natural
number.</li>
<li>the integers (…, -3, -2, -1 0, 1, 2, 3, …) with subtraction: you
take two integers, subtract the second from the first, and you’ll still
have an integer</li>
<li>the real numbers with base 2 logarithm: if you don’t know yet what
that means, you will by the end of the class</li>
<li>the set of all possible strings with concatenation: you will know
very soon what this means</li>
</ul>
<p>But what is an example of something that is not an algebra? Well, the
natural numbers with division, for instance. The natural numbers are 0,
1, 2, 3, and so on, but <span class="math inline">\(\frac{5}{2} =
2.5\)</span>, which is not a natural number. This shows that division
can take two natural numbers as input and return something that is not a
natural number. Hence the natural numbers with division is not an
algebra.</p>
<p>If all those examples got you confused because you don’t quite
remember the difference between natural numbers and integers, or what
exactly a logarithm is, don’t worry. For most of this class, we actually
won’t be using the things you heard about in high school and have
forgotten since then. Where we do need them, they’re slowly introduced
like any other new concept. So don’t worry about this and focus on the
important insight here: whenever you see an abstract definition, think
about what kind of more concrete objects (do not) fit the
definition.</p>
<h3 id="implication-and-equivalence-are-not-the-same">Implication and
equivalence are not the same</h3>
<p>English, as all natural languages, is pretty sloppy in how it
expresses conditions. Consider the following lovely sentence: “If you
don’t give me your money, I will shoot you”. Now the common
understanding is that if you do hand over your money, you will not be
shot. But if your robber happens to be a mathematician you are very
unlucky because they might still shoot you — while you draw your final
breath they will gleefully point out that they didn’t say “If you don’t
give me your money, I will shoot you, and if you give me your money I
will not shoot you.” Your murderer took advantage of the fact that we
often express a biconditional (<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>
implies <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and the other way round)
with the same language we use for implications (<span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> implies <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, but <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> does not necessarily imply <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>). In “If you don’t give me your money,
I will shoot you”, the <em>if</em> is a biconditional, but the very same
<em>if</em> is just an implication in “If it rains, the road is wet” (if
it does not rain, the road may still be wet, e.g. because of a
homeowner’s overzealous sprinklers). English does not explicitly mark
the distinction between a biconditional and an implication, the reader
is supposed to figure it out from context. But in mathematics, the
distinction is very important, and this is why mathematicians explicit
distinguish the implication <em>if</em> from the biconditional
<em>iff</em> (which is short for <em>if and only if</em>). So pay close
attention to whether the text uses an <em>if</em> or an
<em>iff</em>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The following is an implication but not an equivalence/biconditional:
“If you are an actress, then you are female”. After all, not every
female is an actress. On the other hand, “You are a bachelor iff you are
an unmarried man” is a biconditional. Every unmarried man is a bachelor,
and every bachelor (in the non-academic sense) is an unmarried man.</p>
