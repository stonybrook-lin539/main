<h1 id="how-to-read-this-book">How to read this book</h1>
<p>Since you’re reading this, I assume that your mind already has some
method of transferring its written symbols into meaningful sentences.
But sentence-level comprehension is not quite enough. This book doesn’t
follow a familiar linear structure, it is non-linear by design. Before
venturing forth, you should get yourself acquainted with the overall
structure.</p>
<h2 id="parts-chapters-units">Parts, chapters, units</h2>
<p>The books is split into multiple <strong>parts</strong>: <em>Main
units</em>, <em>Background</em>, and <em>Additional Practice
Exercises</em>. I will have more to say on each part below.</p>
<p>Each part consists of multiple <strong>chapters</strong>. Chapters
correspond to broad topics such as n-gram models or finite-state
automata. Each chapter is broken down into <strong>units</strong>, with
each unit illustrating a core aspect of the chapter topic or one of its
linguistic applications. The main body of each unit is interspersed with
offset blocks for examples, exercises, or advice. The end of a unit
usually contains a brief recap with bullet points.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>This, for example, is an example block giving you an example of what
an example block looks like.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Look at the table of contents for this book and identify parts,
chapters, and units.</p>
</div>
<div class="advice">
<p>Take a brief glimpse at some of the units in this book to get a feel
for their length and flow.</p>
</div>
<p>I tried my best to keep each unit short enough that it could make for
a comfy bedtime read. While I didn’t always succeed, I think I did so
most of the time.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>The real meat of this book is in the <em>Main units</em> part, which
will introduce you to how mathematical concepts can be applied to
language and what we can learn from doing so. But this part does not
actually teach you said math. Instead, all information on mathematical
topics is kept separate, for easy reference, in the <em>Background</em>
part.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The chapter on n-gram models in <em>Main units</em> uses sets and
functions, but those concepts aren’t fully explained there. Instead you
have to read specific units in the <em>Background</em> part.</p>
</div>
<p>You are not supposed to read the <em>Background</em> part in a linear
fashion. Instead, the units in <em>Main units</em> will tell you when it
is time to consult a unit in <em>Background</em>. If there is a specific
mathematical concept that you need to be familiar with in order to fully
appreciate a <em>Main</em> unit, that unit will start with a list of
prerequisites, e.g.:</p>
<div class="prereqs">
<ul>
<li>sets (operations, set-relations)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This means that you have to know about set operations like union and
intersection, and the typical relations that can hold between sets
(e.g. subset and superset). If you don’t have the required background,
you should go to the <em>Background</em> chapter about sets and read the
units on operations and set-relations. These units may themselves have
prerequisites. But the book is structured in such a manner that as long
you follow the main units from start to finish without skipping
anything, you will also move through the background units in a linear
fashion so that you should never have to read a background unit for
which you don’t meet the prerequisites yet.</p>
<div class="example">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor">Georg Ferdinand
Luwdig Philipp Cantor</a> wants to read up on n-grams models. He picks
the first unit and is happy to see that it has no prerequisites. But as
the second unit is much more formal, it requires some knowledge of set
theory and functions:</p>
<div class="prereqs">
<ul>
<li>set theory (operations, set-relations)</li>
<li>functions (notation)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>While Cantor got the first one down, he’s a little rusty on his
function notation. So he goes to <em>Background</em> and checks out the
unit on function notation. The unit also requires some set theory, but
since Cantor is on top of that he can read the unit right away. Once
he’s done, he continues with the second unit on n-gram models.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="optional-chapters">Optional chapters</h2>
<p>Some chapters in <em>Main units</em> are marked as optional. This
means that they can be skipped without missing any prerequisites of
later chapters.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The chapter on n-grams in language technology introduces the concept
of multisets. But since no other <em>Main</em> chapters use multisets,
you can skip this optional chapter without missing any background
material that is needed for subsequent <em>Main</em> chapters.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The exercises in the <em>Main</em> and <em>Background</em> units are
created manually and don’t come with solutions (although your instructor
may distribute official solutions in class). The part <em>Additional
practice exercises</em> contains automatically generated exercises, and
those do come with solutions. These mostly test your command of very
mechanical concepts, e.g. computing the union of two sets. The idea is
to give you ample opportunities to practice these calculations until
they are second nature to you. Since they are automatically generated,
these exercises aren’t exactly fun or stimulating. To be honest, they
are quite the grind. But that’s exactly the point: if you struggle with
a basic concept, you can keep grinding it out one problem set at a time
until it finally clicks for you.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<ul>
<li>The book consists of multiple parts, each part consists of chapters,
and chapters consist of units.</li>
<li>Don’t read the <em>Background</em> chapters from start to finish, it
will be incredibly dull. Instead, work your way through the
<em>Main</em> units and only check out a <em>Background</em> unit when
it is listed as a prerequisite.</li>
<li>Each unit comes has exercises interspersed with the main text. But
if you want to practice more, check out the automatically generated
exercises in <em>Additional practice exercises</em>.</li>
