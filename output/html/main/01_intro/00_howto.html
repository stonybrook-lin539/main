<h1 id="how-to-use-these-notes">How to use these notes</h1>
<p>Since you’re reading this, I assume that you already know how to open
the lecture notes. So this section only describes the overall structure
of the lecture notes and how to best navigate them.</p>
<p>The background folder contains information on all kinds of topics,
e.g. sets, relations, graphs, and so on. You’re not supposed to read
those in sequence. Instead, they act as a reference. Each notebook that
is not background material starts with a list of its prerequisites. Some
notebooks (like this one) have no prerequisites and can be read by
anybody as is. Others may list among their prerequisites something like
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>sets (operations, set-relations)</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that you have to know about set operations like union and
intersection, and the typical relations that can hold between sets
(e.g. subset and superset). If you don’t have the required background,
you should go to the background material about sets and read the units
on operations and set-relations. These units may themselves have
prerequisites, so if you don’t meet those either you have to start with
those prerequisites first.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Georg Ferdinand Luwdig Philipp Cantor wants to read up on n-grams
models. He picks the first unit and is happy to see that it has no
prerequisites. But as the second unit is much more formal, it requires
some knowledge of set theory and functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>set theory (operations, set-relations)</li>
<li>functions (notation)</li>
</ul>
<p>While Cantor got the first one down, he’s a little rusty on his
function notation. So he goes to the background section and checks out
the unit on function notation. The unit also requires some set theory,
but since Cantor is on top of that he can read the unit right away. Once
he’s done, he continues with the second unit on n-gram models.</p>
