<h1 id="what-this-book-is-about">What this book is about</h1>
<p>The <em>Little Book of Language, Math, and Computation</em> is a
friendly introduction to mathematical and computational techniques that
can be fruitfully applied to the study of language. This sounds
abstract, so let us look at some brief examples.</p>
<h2 id="example-1-building-words-from-blocks-of-sounds">Example 1:
Building words from blocks of sounds</h2>
<p>Words are made up from sounds, but these sounds cannot be distributed
in a random fashion. While <em>blunder</em> is an English word,
<em>rblnuder</em> is not. In fact, no English word can ever contain the
sound sequence <em>rbln</em>. Similarly, German words never end in
<em>voiced fricatives</em> such as the <code>z</code> in English
<em>zeal</em>. Voiceless fricatives such as <em>s</em> in English
<em>seal</em>, on the other hand, are fine at the end. Linguists have
proposed highly detailed theories to account for the behavior of sounds,
but a surprising amount of empirical ground can be covered by an
extremely simplistic idea: words are built from overlapping blocks of
sounds. With the help of mathematics, we can then ask various questions
about this simplistic system: Does it matter how large our blocks are?
What happens if blocks are allowed to vary in length? Can we sometimes
ignore certain parts of our blocks? Quite generally, how can we modify
and extend this machinery, and how does that affect its empirical
predictions? All of these questions will provide you with simple case
studies of how mathematics allow us to gain a better understanding of
linguistic tools, which in turns enables deeper insights into language
itself.</p>
<h2 id="example-2-have-you-ever-thought-about-ever">Example 2: Have you
ever thought about <em>ever</em>?</h2>
<p>Consider the following sentence of English:</p>
<ol class="example" type="1">
<li>No living person has ever been to Lankhmar.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the exception of referencing a (formerly?) famous fantasy city,
it is utterly unremarkable. But if we replace <em>no</em> with
<em>every</em>, the sentence becomes ill-formed (which linguists
indicate with an asterisk).</p>
<ol start="2" class="example" type="1">
<li>*Every living person has ever been to Lankhmar.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remove <em>ever</em>, and the sentence is fine again.</p>
<ol start="3" class="example" type="1">
<li>Every living person has been to Lankhmar.</li>
</ol>
<p>So now you might think: “Okay, <em>every</em> and <em>ever</em> don’t
like to show up together.” But they can actually show up together.</p>
<ol start="4" class="example" type="1">
<li>Every living person who has ever been to Lankhmar must have been
hallucinating.</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on data like this, linguists have proposed that <em>ever</em>
can only occur in contexts that provide certain kinds of <strong>logical
entailments</strong>. From a mathematical perspective, what is special
about these entailments is that they correspond to <strong>monotonic
functions</strong>. Whenever you are using <em>ever</em>, you are
unwittingly juggling a very abstract mathematical property.</p>
<p>What makes this even more interesting is that monotonic functions
aren’t just connected to <em>ever</em>. Monotonic functions also play a
major role in many other phenomena that are of interest to linguists:
adjectival gradation, case stem syncretism, person case constraints, the
adjunct island constraint, the ban on improper movement, and much more.
Probably most of those terms won’t mean much to you, but the important
point here is that they involve very different aspects of language and
look very different in the formalisms linguists use to analyze them. It
is only through the lens of mathematics, and particularly monotonic
functions, that we gain a unified perspective on these seemingly
unrelated phenomena.</p>
<h2 id="example-3-the-limits-of-word-building">Example 3: The limits of
word building</h2>
<p>In English, a parent of your grand parent is your <em>great grand
parent</em>, their parent is your <em>great great grand parent</em>,
their parent is their <em>great great great grand parent</em>, and so
on. If you wanted to, you could refer to your <em>great great great
great great great great great great great great great great great great
grand parent</em>, although you probably don’t know who that is. Now
consider German. In German, the word for tomorrow is <em>morgen</em>.
The day after tomorrow is <em>übermorgen</em>, the day after that is
<em>überübermorgen</em>, the day after that is
<em>überüberübermorgen</em>, and so on. Again you could use a word like
<em>überüberüberüberüberüberüberüberüberüberüberüberüberüberüberübermorgen</em>,
even though nobody will really understand that you are referring to the
day 17 days after this one. Now contrast that to Ilocáno, an
Austronesian language with about 11 million speakers in the Philippines.
In Ilocáno, the word for tomorrow is <em>bigat</em>, and you can
“sandwich” it between <em>ka</em> and <em>an</em> to get
<em>kabigatan</em>, which refers the day after tomorrow. So Ilocáno
<em>kabigatan</em> is the counterpart to German <em>übermorgen</em>. You
might reasonably expect, then, that we can also have
<em>kakabigatanan</em> or <em>kakakabigatananan</em>. But that doesn’t
seem to be possible. In fact, there seems to be no language that allows
unbounded sandwiching of this type. Why should that be? Why is it okay
to slap <em>über</em> at the beginning of a word as often as you want,
but once it comes to sandwiching you can only do it once?</p>
<p>We will look at one possible answer to this conundrum, which comes in
the form of finite-state machines. We will see that finite-state
machines can handle a lot of linguistic phenomena, and yes, that
includes the addition of arbitrarily many instances of <em>great</em> or
<em>über</em> at the beginning of a word. But they cannot do unbounded
sandwiching. This simply is a harder problem computationally speaking.
Mathematics thus allows us to take patterns and group them into
difficulty classes. Patterns that go beyond a certain threshold of
difficulty do not seem to occur across languages.</p>
<h2 id="intended-audience-and-learning-objectives">Intended audience and
learning objectives</h2>
<p>The book is aimed at undergraduate and graduate students in
linguistics, mathematics, or computer science.</p>
<h3 id="for-linguists">For linguists</h3>
<p>If your background is in linguistics, you will gain familiarity with
mathematical reasoning and how it can supplement and support linguistic
theory building. The goal is not to turn you into a mathematician or
mathematical linguist. While you will encounter some definitions and
proofs, the book doesn’t teach you how to produce new mathematical
results. Instead, the focus is on showing you how this mathematical view
of language can be incorporated into linguistic research in order to
gain additional insights.</p>
<p>With respect to the linguistics audience, then, an alternative title
for this book could be <em>Mathematical Linguistics for Consumers</em>
(rather than producers).</p>
<h3 id="for-mathematicians-and-computer-scientists">For mathematicians
and computer scientists</h3>
<p>If you come from mathematics or computer science, you will gain
exposure to natural language as a rarely explored application for
mathematical inquiry. Ideally, you will find this area of application
fascinating enough to continue your journey into the study of language.
This could take the form of an introductory course on theoretical
linguistics, or a more advanced textbook on mathematical linguistics
(see also the discussion later on in this chapter).</p>
<p>If the book had just been written for mathematics and computer
scientists, then, it could be called <em>Mathematics as a gateway drug
to language science</em>.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>The book presupposes very little mathematical training. You should be
familiar with basic operations such as addition <span
class="math inline">\((5 + 3 = 8)\)</span>, multiplication <span
class="math inline">\((5 \times 3 = 35)\)</span>, exponentiation <span
class="math inline">\((5^3 = 625)\)</span>, and numerical functions,
e.g. <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 2x + 5\)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, you don’t need prior training in linguistics. While we
will encounter many linguistic concepts throughout, care has been taken
to introduce them in sufficient depth that everybody can follow the
discussion. The hedge “sufficient depth” is doing a lot of heavy lifting
here. This is not an introduction to theoretical linguistics. The
discussion of linguistic concepts is often abridged and deliberately
lacking in nuance. The idea is to provide enough background for
developing a mathematical perspective on language, not to teach both
mathematics and linguistics at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="information-for-instructors">Information for instructors</h2>
<p>The book was developed to support the course <em>Mathematical Methods
in Linguistics</em> at Stony Brook University. The course has a very
heterogeneous audience, attracting undergraduate and graduate students
from linguistics, mathematics, and computer science. The course lasts
one semester, which consists of 14 weeks with two 80 minute lectures
each week. The end of this chapter includes suggested weekly
progressions for such a semester format.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you</h2>
<p>I have been working on this book since the first time I taught
<em>Mathematical Methods in Linguistics</em> at Stony Brook, which was
Fall 2017. Selected chapters were also used for guest lectures at Stony
Brook’s <em>Summer Math Camp for High School Students</em> and
<em>Summer Youth Camp in Computational Linguistics</em>. As such, the
book has benefited from a large team of involuntary beta testers, too
many to name them all here. However, some of them graciously provided
explicit feedback and suggestions for improvement that ranged from
spotting typos to extended discussions of why they found certain parts
confusing or dull. I would like to thank all of them for going greatly
beyond the call of duty: Abdelrahim Qaddoumi, Eric Sclafani, Jacob
Rowen, Nikhil Vohra, Shigeto Kamano, Stephan Julien, Yutong Zhang,
Zelalem Amera, and Zhengxiang “Jack” Wang.</p>
<p>In addition, funding through NSF grant BCS-1845344 allowed me to hire
several students to help with the project: Alina Shabaeva, Han Li,
Kenneth Hanson, and Nazila Shafiei. They proofread finished chapters,
created new exercises, and drafted solutions for various exercises. I
would like to particularly thank Alina for the Python code she wrote for
the randomly generated exercises on partial orders and lattices, which
would have taken up more of my time than I had to spend. And Kenneth was
essential for creating the publication infrastructure for this book —
going from a bunch of <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> files to
a beautifully formatted website and just as beautifully typeset PDF
requires a lot of planning and tinkering.<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The
original infrastructure I set up lacked both, and Kenneth stepped in to
retool it into something that’s both robust and flexible enough for a
project of this size.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank the whole field of mathematical
linguistics for providing me with such an infinitely stimulating and
supportive community. This book is a work of passion, and without you
there would be no passion.</p>

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>The reader might be wondering why I
didn’t simply go with <a href="https://bookdown.org">bookdown</a> or a
similar all-in-one solution. The answer is bad timing. When I started
working on this project, bookdown was a young project and didn’t have
enough exposure yet to make it on my radar (this is a value judgment on
my radar rather than bookdown). Once I became aware of it, switching
over to it seemed like a lot more work than keeping the current system.
While the combination of Python code, lua scripts, bash, and LaTeX
macros might not be very user-friendly, it is incredibly flexible. And
it leaves the door open for the one big thing I still hope to add at
some point, which is interactive exercises that students can play around
with in their browser.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
