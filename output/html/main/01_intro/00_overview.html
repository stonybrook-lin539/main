<h1 id="what-this-book-is-about">What this book is about</h1>
<p>The <em>Little Book of Language, Math, and Computation</em> is a
friendly introduction to mathematical and computational techniques that
can be fruitfully applied to the study of language. This sounds
abstract, so let us look at some brief examples.</p>
<h2 id="example-1-building-words-from-blocks-of-sounds">Example 1:
Building words from blocks of sounds</h2>
<p>fixme</p>
<h2 id="example-2-have-you-ever-thought-about-ever">Example 2: Have you
ever thought about <em>ever</em>?</h2>
<p>fixme</p>
<h2 id="example-3-the-limits-of-word-building">Example 3: The limits of
word building</h2>
<p>fixme</p>
<h2 id="intended-audience-and-learning-objectives">Intended audience and
learning objectives</h2>
<p>The book is aimed at undergraduate and graduate students in
Linguistics, Mathematics, or Computer Science.</p>
<h3 id="for-linguists">For linguists</h3>
<p>Linguistics students will gain familiarity with mathematical
reasoning and how it can supplement and support linguistic theory
building. The goal is not to turn these students into mathematicians or
mathematical linguists. While they will encounter some definitions and
proofs, the book doesn’t teach students how to produce new mathematical
results. Instead, the focus in on teaching students how this
mathematical view of language can be incorporated into linguistic
research in order to gain additional insights.</p>
<p>With respect to the linguistics audience, then, an alternative title
for this book could be <em>Mathematical Linguistics for Consumers</em>
(rather than producers).</p>
<h3 id="for-mathematicians-and-computer-scientists">For mathematicians
and computer scientists</h3>
<p>Students in mathematics and computer science will gain exposure to
natural language as a rarely explored area of application for
mathematical inquiry. Ideally, they will find this area of application
fascinating enough to continue their journey into the study of language.
This could take the form of an introductory course on theoretical
linguistics, or a more advanced textbook on mathematical linguistics
(see also the discussion later on in this chapter).</p>
<p>If the book had just been written for mathematics and computer
scientists, then, it could be called <em>Mathematics as a gateway drug
to language science</em>.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>The book presupposes very little mathematical training. Readers
should be familiar with basic operations such as addition,
multiplication, exponentiation, and numerical functions, e.g. <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) = 2x + 5\)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, readers don’t need prior training in linguistics. While we
will encounter many linguistic concepts throughout, care has been taken
to introduce them in sufficient depth that everybody can follow the
discussion. The hedge “sufficient depth” is doing a lot of heavy lifting
here. This is not an introduction to theoretical linguistics. The
discussion of linguistic concepts is often abridged and deliberately
lacking in nuance. The idea is to provide enough background for
developing a mathematical perspective, not to teach both mathematics and
linguistics at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="information-for-instructors">Information for instructors</h2>
<p>The book was developed to support the course <em>Mathematical Methods
in Linguistics</em> at Stony Brook University. The course has a very
heterogeneous audience, attracting undergraduate and graduate students
from linguistics, mathematics, and computer science. The course lasts
one semester, which consists of 14 weeks with two 80 minute lectures
each week. The end of this chapter includes a suggested weekly
progression for instructors.</p>
<h2 id="thank-you">Thank you</h2>
<p>I have been working on this book since the first time I taught
<em>Mathematical Methods in Linguistics</em> at Stony Brook, which was
Fall 2017. Selected chapters were also used for guest lectures at Stony
Brook’s <em>Summer Math Camp for High School Students</em> and
<em>Summer Youth Camp in Computational Linguistics</em>. As such, the
book has benefited from a large team of involuntary beta testers, too
many to name them all here. However, some of them graciously provided
explicit feedback and suggestions for improvement that ranged from
spotting typos to extended discussions of why they found certain parts
confusing or dull. I would like to thank all of them for going greatly
beyond the call of duty: Abdelrahim Qaddoumi, Eric Sclafani, Jacob
Rowen, Nikhil Vohra, Shigeto Kamano, Stephan Julien, Yutong Zhang,
Zelalem Amera, Zhengxiang “Jack” Wang.</p>
<p>In addition, funding through NSF grant BCS-1845344 allowed me to hire
several students to help with the project: Alina Shabaeva, Han Li,
Kenneth Hanson, and Nazila Shafiei. They proofread finished chapters,
creating new exercises, and drafting solutions for the exercises. I
would like to particularly thank Alina for the Python code she wrote for
the randomly generated exercises on partial orders and lattices. And
Kenneth was essential for creating the publication infrastructure for
this book — going from a bunch of <a
href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> files to a beautifully formatted
website and just as beautifully typeset PDF requires a lot of planning
and tinkering.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The original infrastructure I set up
lacked both, and Kenneth stepped in to retool it into something that’s
both robust and flexible enough for a project of this size.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to thank the whole field of mathematical
linguistics for providing me with such an infinitely stimulating and
supportive community. This book is a work of passion, and without you
there would be no passion.</p>

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>The reader might be wondering why I
didn’t simply go with <a href="https://bookdown.org">bookdown</a> or a
similar all-in-one solution. The answer is bad timing. When I started
working on this project, bookdown was barely a year old and didn’t have
enough exposure yet to make it on my radar (this is a value judgment on
my radar rather than bookdown). Once I became aware of it, switching
over to it seemed like a lot more work than keeping the current system.
While the combination of Python code, lua scripts, bash, and LaTeX
macros might not be very user-friendly, it is incredibly flexible. And
it leaves the door open for the one big thing I still hope to add at
some point, which is interactive exercises that students can play around
with in their browser.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
