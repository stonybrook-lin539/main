<div class="exercise">
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span>, no grammar ever
needs to contain every member of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_E^n\)</span>. Explain why.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>There are two answers here. First, if <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_E^n\)</span> is taken to contain useless
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams like <span
class="math inline">\({{{R}}}{{{L}}}\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\({{{R}}}ab\)</span>, then these do not need to be
included in the grammar because no string will ever have <span
class="math inline">\({{{R}}}\)</span> preceding another symbol that is
not <span class="math inline">\({{{R}}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Second, it is also true that there is always a more compact
alternative to using a grammar that contains every member of <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_E^n\)</span>. Suppose that you have a
positive grammar that contains every possible <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_E\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span>. In this case, the grammar
generates <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^*\)</span>, the set of all
possible strings over <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>. But
<span class="math inline">\(\Sigma^*\)</span> could have just as well
been defined by a negative grammar <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> that forbids no <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams at all (formally, <span
class="math inline">\(G = \emptyset\)</span>). Similarly, suppose that
you have a negative grammar that contains every possible <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma_E\)</span>, with <span
class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span>. In this grammar, nothing is
allowed at all, not even the empty string, so the grammar generates the
empty language <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span>. But the
empty language could also be generated by the positive <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> that contains no <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams at all (formally, <span
class="math inline">\(G = \emptyset\)</span>).</p>
<p>The same strategy of switching polarities can be used to show that
for every <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grammar <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> that contains more than half of all
possible <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams (rounded up) there
is a smaller grammar of opposite polarity that generates the same string
language as <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
