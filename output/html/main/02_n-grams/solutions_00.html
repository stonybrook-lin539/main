<p>Consider the word <em>supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</em>. For

<li>pail: no</li>
<li>sit: no</li>
<li>co: no</li>
<li>super: no</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong><br />
We assume for this exercise that the relevant symbols are the characters
of the English alphabet that are used to spell
<em>supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</em>, rather than the sounds that
are uttered when pronouncing the word.</p>
<p>Bigrams consist of exactly two symbols. Consequently, none of the
following are bigrams:</p>
<ul>
<li>z (only 1 symbol)</li>
<li>doci (4 symbols)</li>
<li>pail (4 symbols)</li>
<li>sit (3 symbols)</li>
<li>super (5 symbols)</li>
</ul>
<p>As these are not bigrams, they cannot be bigrams of
<em>supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</em>. That leaves us with only
two contenders:</p>
<ul>
<li>fr</li>
<li>co</li>
</ul>
<p>The bigrams of the word <em>supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</em>
are <em>ag, al, ca, ce, ci, do, er, ex, fr, gi, ia, ic, id, if, il, io,
is, li, oc, ou, pe, pi, ra, rc, st, su, ti, up, us, xp</em>. As you can
see, <em>fr</em> is in this list, but <em>co</em> is not. Among all the
items listed in the exercise, then, only <em>fr</em> is a bigram.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Consider once more the word
<em>supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</em>. Which one of the following
is among its bigrams (with edge markers):</p>
<ul>
<li>fr</li>
<li>z</li>
<li>⋊⋉</li>
<li>⋊s</li>
<li>s⋉⋉</li>
</ul>

<li>fr: yes</li>
<li>z: no</li>
<li>⋊⋉: no</li>
<li>⋊s: yes</li>
<li>s⋉⋉: no</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong><br />
Once we consider edge markers, the long list of bigrams from the
previous solution gains two new members: <em>⋊s</em> and <em>s⋉</em>.
Bigrams that were already on the original list without edge markers are
still bigrams, so <em>fr</em> is still a bigram of
<em>supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</em>. Similarly <em>n</em>-grams
that do not consist of exactly two symbols are still not possible
bigrams, which rules out <em>z</em> (only 1 symbol) and <em>s⋉⋉</em> (3
symbols). This leaves us with ⋊⋉ and ⋊s. The latter is one of the two
new members, but the former is not. In fact, ⋊⋉ can never be a bigram of
any string that consists of one or more symbols.</p>

<li>cious: none of those choices</li>
<li>⋊sup: 4-gram</li>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>⋊fr: the word starts with <em>su</em>, not <em>fr</em>, so
<em>⋊fr</em> does not occur in the word</li>
<li>z: this is a unigram, but we are only considering bigrams, trigrams,
and 4-grams; and even if we did, the word does not contain <em>z</em> at
all</li>
<li>do⋉c: this is a 4-gram but it can never occur in any string because
it is impossible to have any symbol after ⋉</li>
<li>s⋉⋉⋉: this is a 4-gram; for 4-grams, we have to assume at least
three edge markers on each side of the string, and since the word ends
in <em>s</em>, the string with edge markers must indeed contain
s⋉⋉⋉</li>
<li>sit: this is a trigram, but it does not occur in the word</li>
<li>cious: this is a 5-gram that occurs in the word, but we are only
considering bigrams, trigrams, and 4-grams</li>
<li>⋊sup: this is a 4-gram and since the word starts with <em>sup</em>,
<em>⋊sup</em> is indeed a 4-gram of the string once we include edge
markers</li>

<div class="exercise">
<p>Suppose a language has the vowels <em>a</em> and <em>u</em>, the
voiced consonants <em>z</em> and <em>v</em>, and the voiceless
consonants <em>s</em> and <em>f</em>. The language also has intervocalic
voicing, which means that a voiceless consonant may not occur
immediately between two vowels. Write an <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar that expresses this
fact.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>The grammar consists of the following forbidden trigrams: <em>asa,
asu, usa, usu, afa, afu, ufa, ufu</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong><br />
We want to describe intervocalic voicing by a list of forbidden
<em>n</em>-grams. The first question is what value we should pick for
<em>n</em>. In general, we want to forbid strings that contain patterns
of the form VsV and VfV, where V is a shorthand for our vowels
<em>a</em> and <em>u</em>. Crucially, there is nothing wrong with
patterns like Vs, sV, Vf, fV — <em>s</em> and <em>z</em> are allowed to
occur next to a vowel, it is only a problem when they are sandwiched
between vowels. Strings like <em>af</em>, <em>afzi</em>, or
<em>afsi</em> should be allowed, but not <em>afi</em>. With bigrams, we
cannot make this distinction. For example, the ill-formed <em>afi</em>
contains only bigrams that also occur in the well-formed
<em>afzizfi</em>, which makes it impossible to write a bigram grammar
that rules out <em>afi</em> but still permits <em>afzizfi</em>. Hence we
take a step up from bigrams to trigrams, and then it becomes a simple
matter of listing all trigrams where the first and third position are
filled by vowels, and the second is filled by a voiceless consonant.</p>

<div class="exercise">
<p>Consider the formal language where all strings are sequences of
<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> such that</p>
<ul>
<li>every string starts with <em>a</em></li>
<li>no string ends with <em>c</em></li>
<li><em>a</em> and <em>c</em> are always separated by at least two
symbols.</li>
</ul>
<p>Write a negative <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar
for this language such that all <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams have the same length.</p>
<div class="solution">
<ul>
<li>⋊⋊b</li>
<li>⋊⋊c</li>
<li>c⋉⋉</li>
<li>ac⋉</li>
<li>aca</li>
<li>acb</li>
<li>acc</li>
<li>ca⋉</li>
<li>caa</li>
<li>cab</li>
<li>cac</li>
<li>abc</li>
<li>cba</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p>This exercise is a little tricky because we have to consider all
three constraints first before we can decide on a value for <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Requiring that every string starts with <em>a</em> would only require
bigrams: <em>⋊b</em> and <em>⋊c</em> make it impossible to start with
<em>b</em> and <em>c</em>, and ⋊⋉ rules out the empty string, so we can
only start with <em>a</em>. And the bigram <em>c⋉</em> is all that is
needed to ensure that no string ends with <em>c</em>.</p>
<p>The third condition, however, cannot be expressed with bigrams. If
<em>a</em> and <em>c</em> are always separated by at least two symbols,
then we cannot have <em>a</em> and <em>c</em> next to each other, and we
cannot have them in positions with only one symbol between them. For
example, we cannot have <em>abc</em> as part of any string. This
requires us to use trigrams. The grammar has to contain every trigram
where <em>a</em> is in position one and <em>c</em> is in position two,
or the other way round:</p>
<ul>
<li>ac⋉</li>
<li>aca</li>
<li>acb</li>
<li>acc</li>
<li>ca⋉</li>
<li>caa</li>
<li>cab</li>
<li>cac</li>
</ul>
<p>We could also add all trigrams where <em>a</em> is in position two
and <em>c</em> in position three, or the other way round. But this would
be redundant. Suppose our sliding window moves through the string from
left to right, and that at step <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>
the sliding window sees a trigram with <em>a</em> in the second position
and <em>c</em> in the third position. But then at the very next step,
<span class="math inline">\(s+1\)</span>, the sliding window moves one
step to the right and <em>a</em> is now in the first position and
<em>c</em> in the second position. In other words, if <em>a</em> and
<em>c</em> are ever adjacent in the string, then it is guaranteed that
the string contains some trigram that has <em>a</em> and <em>c</em> as
its first two symbols, and hence it is sufficient to rule out just these
trigrams.</p>
<p>Our trigram grammar now rules out adjacent <em>a</em> and <em>c</em>,
but we also have to list all the cases where <em>a</em> and <em>c</em>
are separated by one symbol, whatever that symbol may be. Once again,
though, we can be smart about this. We do not need to consider any
trigrams of the form <em>axc</em> or <em>cxa</em> where <em>x</em> is
<em>a</em> or <em>c</em> since those are already ruled out by the
trigrams that forbid adjacent <em>a</em> and <em>c</em>. But then the
only remaining option for <em>x</em> is <em>b</em>, giving us just two
additional trigrams:</p>
<ul>
<li>abc</li>
<li>cba</li>
</ul>
<p>Alright, these 10 trigrams handle the third condition that <em>a</em>
and <em>c</em> must be separated by at least two symbols. But since we
had to use trigrams to handle this condition, the exercise requires us
to state the first two conditions in terms of trigrams, too.
Fortunately, that’s not too difficult. Instead of <em>⋊b</em> and
<em>⋊c</em>, we forbid <em>⋊⋊b</em> and <em>⋊⋊c</em>. And instead of
<em>c⋉</em>, we forbid <em>c⋉⋉</em>. Again we do not need to add
trigrams like <em>ac⋉</em> because every string that contains this
trigram also contains <em>c⋉⋉</em>, which means that the former is
redundant if the grammar already contains the latter.</p>
