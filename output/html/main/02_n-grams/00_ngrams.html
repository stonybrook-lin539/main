<h1 id="n-gram-models-of-grammaticality">N-gram models of
grammaticality</h1>
<p>This unit presents a very simple model of language. As you will see,
even simple models can give rise to complex questions, questions that
cannot easily be answered without math. It might not look like the math
you know from high school, but it is still math (some might say it is
the high school math that barely qualifies as math because it is about
calculating rather than reasoning).</p>
<p>If you already have some mathematical experience, you might want to
skip two sections ahead and only come back here to see the linguistic
motivation for the mathematics. And the trained linguist may find some
of the content here overly simplistic, but we will move on to more
intricate problems as our mathematical toolkit grows.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-fact-about-english">A simple fact about English</h2>
<p>English has a large number of different sounds, but not all
combinations are possible. For instance, <em>blink</em> is a word put
<em>kbinl</em> is not. And <em>kbinl</em> will never be a word of
English because it does not obey English <strong>phonotactics</strong>,
i.e. the laws that govern the sequence of sounds. This is what separates
<em>kbinl</em> from <em>kobinal</em> or <em>karbinolium</em>. None of
them are existing words of English, but <em>kobinal</em> and
<em>karbinolium</em> are potential words. We can give them a meaning,
start using them, and no native speaker of English will have a problem
picking them up. That is because their phonotactics are well-formed.</p>
<p>The knowledge of English phonotactics is what allows native speakers
to coin new terms that fit in with the rest of the vocabulary. It is
also what makes it hard for English speakers to learn other languages.
German, for example, is very happy to start a word with <em>k</em> and
<em>n</em>, as in <em>Knoblauch</em>, the German word for garlic.
English has words that are spelled with <em>kn</em> at the start, like
<em>knight</em>, but the <em>k</em> is never pronounced. As far as
phonotactics is concerned, <em>knight</em> and <em>night</em> are the
same word. Phonotactics is one of the most basic aspects of natural
language. By natural language I mean languages like English, Chinese,
Tongan, Inuktitut, various dialects of Italian, or the specific language
that you grew up with. This is in contrast to formal languages, which
were designed by humans, e.g. Esperanto, Klingon, or the programming
language Python. Linguists want, among other things, to precisely
formulate the laws of natural language phonotactics. They want to do
this at both the language-specific level and across languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language specific</strong>: What are the phonotactics of
English? German? Language X?</li>
<li><strong>General</strong>: What is a possible phonotactic system?
What shape can the laws of phonotactics take? What kind of logically
conceivable systems of phonotactics can never occur in a natural
language?</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to tackle these questions in a precise manner, we need a
formal model of phonotactics. What might that be? It is a safe
assumption that a word is phonotactically well-formed iff none of its
subparts are ill-formed. So <em>kobinal</em> is a possible word because
there is nothing wrong with a word that starts with <em>kobina</em>, has
<em>obina</em> in the middle, and ends with <em>obinal</em>. But this
just raises the question why <em>kobina</em> is an acceptable start, and
<em>obina</em> is a well-formed middle, and <em>obinal</em> is an
acceptable end. Well, because their subparts are fine. For example,
<em>kobina</em> is fine because a word can start with <em>kobin</em> and
have <em>obin</em> in the middle and <em>bina</em> at the end. Then why
can a word start with <em>kobin</em>? Well, because its subparts are
fine: a word can start with <em>kobi</em>, have <em>obi</em> in the
middle, and <em>obin</em> at the end. As you can already see, we can
play that game for a long time, breaking well-formed parts into smaller
well-formed parts.</p>
<p>But eventually, things will break down. If we want to know why
<em>ko</em> is a good start, it’s not enough to say that words can start
with <em>k</em> and have <em>o</em> in the middle. Because it is also
true that words can start with <em>k</em> and have <em>b</em> in the
middle (as in <em>kobinal</em>), yet <em>kbinal</em> is not okay even
though it starts with <em>k</em> and has a <em>b</em> in the middle. By
looking at individual sounds, we have decomposed things too much to
capture the phonotactics of English. So let’s take one step up and
consider pairs of consecutive sounds. In more technical terms, let’s
describe English phonotactics in terms of <strong>bigrams</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="bigrams">Bigrams</h2>
<h3 id="extracting-bigrams">Extracting bigrams</h3>
<p>A bigram is a string of two elements. For phonotactics, the elements
are sounds (to all trained linguists: we do not need to distinguish
between phones, allophones, or phonemes yet, so please don’t get your
panties in a twist). Examples of bigrams include <em>ko</em>,
<em>ob</em>, or <em>bn</em>. A given word’s <strong>set of
bigrams</strong> is the collection of all bigrams that occur in it,
without repetitions.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The bigrams of <em>kobinal</em> are <em>ko</em>, <em>ob</em>,
<em>bi</em>, <em>in</em>, <em>na</em>, and <em>al</em>. The bigrams of
<em>banana</em> are <em>ba</em>, <em>an</em>, and <em>na</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Consider the word <em>supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</em>. For
each one of the following, say whether it is a bigram of the word.</p>
<ul>
<li>fr</li>
<li>z</li>
<li>doci</li>
<li>pail</li>
<li>sit</li>
<li>co</li>
<li>super</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="adding-edge-markers">Adding edge markers</h3>
<p>One shortcoming of this simple notion of bigrams is that one cannot
tell which bigrams occurred at the beginning and the end of the word.
For example, <em>ababa</em> and <em>babab</em> have the same bigrams,
<em>ab</em> and <em>ba</em>.</p>
<p>But for phonotactics it is actually important to know how a word
starts and how it ends. We have to make some changes to capture this
information with bigrams. Concretely, we will add edge markers. One
could use a single edge marker like <em>$</em>. In that case,
<em>ababa</em> would be <em>$ababa$</em>, and <em>babab</em> would be
<em>$babab$</em>. But once we dive deeper into the mathematics, it will
be more convenient to have separate markers: ⋊ for the left edge and ⋉
for the right edge. This means that <em>ababa</em> will be
<em>⋊ababa⋉</em>, and <em>babab</em> will be <em>⋊babab⋉</em>.</p>
<p>Now one can tell clearly which bigrams occurred at the start and the
end.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>To calculate the bigrams of <em>kobinal</em>, we first expand it to
<em>⋊kobinal⋉</em>. Then we extract bigrams as usual, giving us the
following list: <em>⋊k</em>, <em>ko</em>, <em>ob</em>, <em>bi</em>,
<em>in</em>, <em>na</em>, <em>al</em>, <em>l⋉</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Consider once more the word
<em>supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</em>. Which one of the following
is among its bigrams (with edge markers):</p>
<ul>
<li>fr</li>
<li>z</li>
<li>⋊⋉</li>
<li>⋊s</li>
<li>s⋉⋉</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="bigram-grammars">Bigram grammars</h2>
<p>So now that we have a firm grasp of bigrams, it is actually fairly
easy to formulate our first hypothesis about natural language
phonotactics: every phonotactic system is described by a set of
forbidden bigrams. If a word contains at least one forbidden bigram, it
is illicit. We call such a collection of forbidden bigrams a
<strong>negative bigram grammar</strong>.</p>
<p>If our hypothesis is correct, then it should be possible to write
down a collection of bigrams for English so that all phonotactically
well-formed words are allowed, and only those. Every ill-formed word
must contain at least one forbidden bigram.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Contrast the well-formed <em>kobinal</em> against the ill-formed
<em>kbin</em>. If <em>kb</em> is a forbidden bigram of English, then
<em>kbin</em> is ill-formed. In order for <em>kobinal</em> to be
well-formed, none of the following bigrams may be forbidden:
<em>⋊k</em>, <em>ko</em>, <em>ob</em>, <em>bi</em>, <em>in</em>,
<em>na</em>, <em>al</em>, <em>l⋉</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>As the example above shows, forbidding the bigram <em>kb</em> rules
out <em>kbin</em> as an illicit word for English. But there is a
problem: <em>kb</em> does occur in some well-formed words, such as
<em>cookbook</em> or <em>workbench</em>. Linguists might object that
each one of them is a compound and thus, as far as phonotactics is
concerned, might be two words rather than one. However, that does not
solve the problem of Star Wars’s Admiral Ackbar, pronounced
<em>akbar</em>. The problem with <em>kbin</em> is not <em>kb</em>, it’s
<em>kb</em> at the start of the word. The forbidden sequence is not
<em>kb</em>, but rather <em>⋊kb</em>. This is a
<strong>trigram</strong>, not a bigram.</p>
<h2 id="n-gram-grammars">n-gram grammars</h2>
<p>We can generalize the notion of bigram to sequences of arbitrary
length. A trigram is a sequence of three elements, a 4-gram contains
four elements, and quite generally, an <strong>n-gram</strong> consists
of <strong>n</strong> elements.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let us first look at the bigrams, trigrams, and 4-grams of
<em>kobinal</em> (without edge markers). The bigrams of <em>kobinal</em>
are <em>ko</em>, <em>ob</em>, <em>bi</em>, <em>in</em>, <em>na</em>, and
<em>al</em>. The trigrams are <em>kob</em>, <em>obi</em>, <em>bin</em>,
<em>ina</em>, and <em>nal</em>. The 4-grams are <em>kobi</em>,
<em>obin</em>, <em>bina</em>, and <em>inal</em>.</p>
<p>For <em>banana</em>, the only bigrams are <em>ba</em>, <em>an</em>,
and <em>na</em>. The trigrams are <em>ban</em>, <em>ana</em>, and
<em>nan</em>. The 4-grams are <em>bana</em>, <em>anan</em>, and
<em>nana</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>One problem with large <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams
is that some words may be shorter than <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> even after edge markers have been
added. Just what are the 4-grams of <em>⋊a⋉</em>? To avoid this, we pad
out the word with <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> edge
markers.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider now the bigrams, trigrams, and 4-grams of <em>kobinal</em>
with edge markers ⋊ and ⋉. For bigrams, we have to look at
<em>⋊kobinal⋉</em>, which has the bigrams <em>⋊k</em>, <em>ko</em>,
<em>ob</em>, <em>bi</em>, <em>in</em>, <em>na</em>, <em>al</em>, and
<em>l⋉</em>. The trigrams are computed over <em>⋊⋊kobinal⋉⋉</em>, so
they’re <em>⋊⋊k</em>, <em>⋊ko</em>, <em>kob</em>, <em>obi</em>,
<em>bin</em>, <em>nal</em>, <em>al⋉</em>, and <em>l⋉⋉</em>. The 4-grams
are computed over <em>⋊⋊⋊kobinal⋉⋉⋉</em> and thus they are
<em>⋊⋊⋊k</em>, <em>⋊⋊ko</em>, <em>⋊kob</em>, <em>kobi</em>,
<em>obin</em>, <em>bina</em>, <em>inal</em>, <em>nal⋉</em>,
<em>al⋉⋉</em>, and <em>l⋉⋉⋉</em>.</p>
<p>For <em>banana</em>, the bigrams are now <em>⋊b</em>, <em>ba</em>,
<em>an</em>, <em>na</em>, and <em>a⋉</em>. Its trigrams are
<em>⋊⋊b</em>, <em>⋊ba</em>, <em>ban</em>, <em>ana</em>, <em>nan</em>,
<em>na⋉</em>, and <em>a⋉⋉⋉</em>. The 4-grams are <em>⋊⋊⋊b</em>,
<em>⋊⋊ba</em>, <em>⋊⋊ban</em>, <em>bana</em>, <em>anan</em>,
<em>nana</em>, <em>ana⋉, </em>na⋉⋉<em>, and </em>a⋉⋉⋉*.</p>
</div>
<p>Now we can finally state clearly why <em>kobinal</em>,
<em>workbench</em> and <em>akbar</em> are all phonotactically
well-formed, whereas <em>kbin</em> is not: the latter contains the
illicit trigram <em>⋊kb</em>.</p>
<p>We also refine our original hypothesis about the phonotactics of
natural languages: every phonotactic system is described by a set of
forbidden <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Consider once more the word
<em>supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</em>. For each one of the
following, say whether it is a bigram of the word (with edge markers), a
trigram, a 4-gram, or none of those choices.</p>
<ul>
<li>⋊fr</li>
<li>z</li>
<li>do⋉c</li>
<li>s⋉⋉⋉</li>
<li>sit</li>
<li>cious</li>
<li>⋊sup</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Suppose a language has the vowels <em>a</em> and <em>u</em>, the
voiced consonants <em>z</em> and <em>v</em>, and the voiceless
consonants <em>s</em> and <em>f</em>. The language also has intervocalic
voicing, which means that no voiceless consonants may occur between
vowels. Write an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar
that expresses this fact.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="a-look-at-german">A look at German</h2>
<p>Unlike English, German is perfectly fine with words that starts with
<em>kn</em>. But just like English, it does not like words that start
with <em>rb</em>. We can capture this by writing a trigram grammar for
German that contains the forbidden trigram <em>⋊rb</em>. But German also
has a process known as word-final devoicing: voiced sounds become
voiceless at the end of a word. So whereas an English speaker will
happily pronounce <em>woods</em> with a <em>z</em> at the end, a German
speaker turns the <em>z</em> into an <em>s</em> like in
<em>trinkets</em>. Alright, no big deal, we just forbid <em>z⋉</em> too.
Or do we?</p>
<p>We now have a forbidden trigram <em>⋊rb</em> and a forbidden bigram
<em>z⋉</em>. Are we allowed to mix bigrams and trigrams this way? More
generally, can every negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar also contain <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-grams, where <span
class="math inline">\(k &lt; n\)</span>? Could this create
inconsistencies, or make negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars more powerful? We’ll see
in the next section.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Consider the formal language where all strings are sequences of
<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> such that</p>
<ul>
<li>every string starts with <em>a</em></li>
<li>no string ends with <em>c</em></li>
<li><em>a</em> and <em>c</em> are always separated by at least two
symbols.</li>
</ul>
<p>Write a negative <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar
for this language such that all <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams have the same length.</p>
