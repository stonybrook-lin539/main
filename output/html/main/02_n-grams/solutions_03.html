<li>We have to forbid trigrams of the form <span
class="math inline">\(xyz\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> are vowels and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is a voiceless fricative. The exercise
tells us that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> can be <em>a</em>, <em>i</em>, or
<em>u</em>, and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> can be <em>s</em>
or <em>f</em>. After carrying out all possible substitutions of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, we get the list of forbidden trigrams
above.</li>
<li>If <em>n</em> must be <em>m</em> before <em>b</em> or <em>p</em>,
this means that we can never have an <em>n</em> followed by <em>b</em>
or <em>p</em> (because then we would have a case where <em>n</em> failed
to turn into <em>m</em>). Hence we forbid the bigrams <em>nb</em> and
<em>np</em>.</li>
<li>The exercise describes local dissimilation as a process where
<em>r</em> changes to <em>l</em> if it is followed by <em>Vr</em>. In
terms of phonotactics, this means that we cannot have <em>r</em>
followed by <em>Vr</em>. Replacing <em>V</em> with all possible choices
for a vowel, we get the forbidden trigrams <em>rar</em>, <em>rir</em>,
and <em>rur</em>.</li>
<li>This one is tricky because we have to consider multiple cases. If a
word has just one syllable, then it is not subject to the penultimate
stress rule (which only applies to words with at least two syllables),
and hence stress falls on the last syllable in this case. In other
words, monosyllabic words must be of the form <span
class="math inline">\(\acute{\sigma}\)</span>, whereas <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is not allowed. If a word has
exactly two syllables, then it must be of the form <span
class="math inline">\(\acute{\sigma} \sigma\)</span> because the other
option <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \acute{\sigma}\)</span> would
violate the penultimate stress rule. And if a word has three or more
syllables, then it must be of the form <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^+ \acute{\sigma} \sigma\)</span>. Based on
this, we can deduce what must be forbidden: First, we do not want to
allow words like <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, so our
grammar must contain the forbidden trigram <span
class="math inline">\({{{L}}} \sigma {{{R}}}\)</span>. We also do not
want to allow any word with at least two syllables where stress falls on
the last syllable, and thus we add the forbidden trigram <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma \acute{\sigma} {{{R}}}\)</span>. We do not
want to allow any word that ends with two unstressed syllables, which we
capture with the forbidden trigram <span class="math inline">\(\sigma
\sigma {{{R}}}\)</span>. The combination of <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma \acute{\sigma} {{{R}}}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma \sigma{{{R}}}\)</span> guarantees that if a
word has at least two syllables, the last but one is stressed. But
that’s not quite enough, we also have to ensure that this is the only
syllable that is stressed. That is the same as saying that we do not to
allow any word where the stressed syllable is followed by at least two
unstressed syllables, and thus we also forbid the trigram <span
class="math inline">\(\acute{\sigma} \sigma \sigma\)</span>. And that’s
it, nothing else is required.</li>

<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams, say how large it is depending on
what one chooses as the basic symbols that <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams are built from. Possible choices
for building blocks are typed characters, morphemes, or words. Not all
choice may be appropriate in each case.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>de-</em></li>
<li><em>mpi</em></li>
<li><em>John likes Mary</em></li>
</ol>
<div class="solution">
<ol type="1">
<li><em>de-</em>: It could be a unigram consisting just of the morpheme
<em>de-</em>, or a trigram that consists of the characters <em>d</em>,
<em>e</em>, and a hyphen.</li>
<li><em>mpi</em>: The only reasonable treatment here is as a trigram
consisting of the characters <em>m</em>, <em>p</em>, and
<em>i</em>.</li>
<li><em>John likes Mary</em>: This could be a trigram that consists of
the words <em>John</em>, <em>likes</em>, and <em>Mary</em>, or a 4-gram
that consists of the morphemes <em>John</em>, <em>like</em>, <em>s</em>,
and <em>Mary</em>, or a 15-gram that consists of a long sequence of
letters and spaces.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Write both a positive and a negative grammar that each allow only
strings of the form <em>ab</em>, <em>abab</em>, <em>ababab</em>,
<em>abababab</em>, and so on (assume that all symbols are either
<em>a</em> or <em>b</em>). Is one of the two grammars more succinct or
general than the other? What if the set of symbols is larger,
e.g. <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, and <em>d</em>?</p>
<div class="solution">
<ul>
<li><strong>positive grammar</strong>: <span
class="math inline">\({{{L}}}a, b{{{R}}}, ab, ba\)</span></li>
<li><strong>negative grammar</strong>: <span
class="math inline">\({{{L}}}b, a{{{R}}}, aa, bb,
{{{L}}}{{{R}}}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The two grammars are very similar in size, the only difference is
that the negative grammar also has to block the empty string. However,
when the set of symbols gets larger, the positive grammar stays the same
but the negative grammar will need more bigrams to rule out the illicit
combinations.</p>
</div>
<div class="solution_explained">
<p>The general pattern is that strings must start with <em>a</em>, must
end with <em>b</em>, and that <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> must alternate.
The positive grammar states this very directly with its bigrams <span
class="math inline">\({{{L}}}a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{ab}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{ba}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(b{{{R}}}\)</span>. The negative grammar, on the
other hand, captures this more indirectly. For example: instead of
“start with <em>a</em>”, the negative grammars says “start with a
symbol” (<span class="math inline">\({{{L}}}{{{R}}}\)</span>) and “do
not start with <em>b</em>” (<span
class="math inline">\({{{L}}}b\)</span>). But if there’s more symbols
than just <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, the negative grammar also has to
say “do not start with <em>c</em>” (<span
class="math inline">\({{{L}}}c\)</span>), “do not start with <em>d</em>”
(<span class="math inline">\({{{L}}}d\)</span>), and so on. As the
number of symbols increases, more and more options need to be
blocked.</p>
<p>Quite generally, a negative grammar will be very large when the
majority of logically possible combinations is impossible. In this case,
a positive grammar is smaller. But on the flip side, if most
combinations are allowed and only a small number need to be ruled out,
the negative grammar will be smaller.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following phenomena, write a positive <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar that handles it correctly.
For some of them, you have to rephrase the phenomenon as a phonotactic
constraint first.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>intervocalic voicing</strong>: voiceless fricatives (assume

</ul>
<p>Once you’re done, contrast the positive grammars against the negative
ones from an earlier exercise. Can you identify some general guidelines
for when a positive grammar is preferable to a negative one?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>This exercise requires a lot more assumptions than the one for
negative grammars. The problem is that it is not enough to know how
intervocalic voicing works, we also have to know what the rest of the
language looks like. Consider the case of intervocalic voicing. With the
negative grammar, it was enough to say that <em>s</em> and <em>f</em>
may not occur between the vowels <em>a</em>, <em>i</em>, and <em>u</em>.
With the positive grammar, we instead have to allow for every possible
trigram except the ones where <em>s</em> or <em>f</em> occurs between
<em>a</em>, <em>i</em> and <em>u</em>. But we do not actually know what
the set of all possible trigrams is because the exercise does not
specify the alphabet. If the alphabet contains only <em>a</em>,
<em>i</em>, <em>u</em>, <em>s</em>, <em>f</em>, and <em>k</em>, then the
set of possible trigrams is much smaller compared to an alphabet that
also contains all the other consonants of English.</p>
<p>For this reason, each answer must always specify the assumed
alphabet. And ideally, this alphabet will be small to reduce the number
of <em>n</em>-grams that need to be written down. Even then, though,
these grammars will be very large. They contain all possible <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams except the ones that were listed
in the negative grammar.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>English allows for <em>nature</em>, <em>natural</em>,
<em>naturalize</em>, <em>denaturalize</em>, <em>naturalization</em>, and
<em>denaturalization</em>, but not <em>denature</em> or any other
misordered forms like <em>naturizalation</em> (actually there is a
technical term <em>denature</em>, but it is not very common and we’ll
exclude it here to keep the exercise simple). Write a grammar that
generates all the well-formed forms but none of the ill-formed ones. It
is up to you whether you want to use a positive or a negative grammar.
If you use a negative grammar, it can be in the mixed format, with <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams of varying lengths.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>A negative mixed grammar is the easiest option here. As our alphabet,
we assume the morphemes <em>de-</em>, <em>nature</em>, <em>-al</em>,
<em>-ize</em>, and <em>-ation</em>. The negative grammar then contains
the following <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You must start with <em>de-</em> or <em>nature</em>: ⋊ -al, ⋊ -ize,
⋊ -ation</li>
<li><em>de-</em> can only be followed by <em>nature</em>: de- de-, de-
-al, de -ize, de -ation, de ⋉</li>
<li><em>nature</em> can only be followed by <em>-al</em> or the end of
the word: nature de-, nature nature, nature -ize, nature -ation</li>
<li><em>-al</em> can only be followed by <em>-ize</em> or the end of the
word: -al de-, -al nature, -al -al, -al -ation</li>
<li><em>-ize</em> can only be followed by <em>-ation</em> or the end of
the word: -ize -de, -ize nature, -ize -al, -ize -ize</li>
<li><em>-ation</em> can only be followed by the end of the word: -ation
-de, -ation nature, -ation -al, -ation -ize, -ation -ation</li>
<li>Do not end in <em>denature</em> or <em>denatural</em>: de- nature ⋉,
de- nature -al ⋉</li>
