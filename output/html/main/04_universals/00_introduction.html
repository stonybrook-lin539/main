<p>This chapter takes a deep dive into monotonicity and the role it
seems to play in natural language. We will look at a wide range of
phenomena in morphology (word structure), syntax (sentence structure),
and morphosyntax (how sentence structure interacts with word structure).
Among other things, we will discuss the influential *ABA generalization,
the distribution of negative polarity items like <em>ever</em>, the
typology of Person Case constraints (PCCs), and the phenomenon of
adjunct island effects. As part of that discussion, we will encounter
several new mathematical concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>relations as a generalization of functions,</li>
<li>tuples like <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,2,1 \right
\rangle\)</span>, which in contrast to sets are ordered and may contain
multiple instances of the same element,</li>
<li>linear orders and partial orders,</li>
<li>semilattices and lattices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before you proceed, you should make sure that you are on top of the
mathematical prerequisites listed at the beginning of this unit as these
will be presupposed throughout this chapter without being explicitly
listed as prerequisites at the top of each unit.</p>
