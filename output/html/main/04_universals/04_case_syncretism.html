<p>Monotonicity also seems to play a role in a phenomenon called
<strong>case syncretism</strong>. As you probably know, some languages
have specific endings that go on nouns to indicate their case. A subject
might usually be nominative case, whereas an object could be accusative
or dative, and a possessor might have genitive case. Case syncretism
refers to the phenomenon that a word ends up using identical forms for
distinct cases. Once again not every logically conceivable system is
actually attested. Languages seem to be very finicky in what kinds of
case syncretism they allow, and we would like to know why that is
so.</p>
<h2 id="a-primer-on-case-syncretism">A primer on case syncretism</h2>
<p>We still see small reflexes of case syncretism in English, where the
personal pronouns have different forms:</p>

<p>The table above is called a <strong>morphological paradigm</strong>,
where <strong>morphology</strong> means that we are talking about the
form of words, and a <strong>paradigm</strong> is a collection of cells
that specify the relation between the forms of a word and their
function. In the case at hand, those functions are subject, object, and
possessor. As you can see, <em>her</em> is the form for both the object
and the possessor, and <em>it</em> is the form for both the subject and
the object. Such cases where multiple cells of a paradigm look the same
are called <strong>syncretism</strong>.</p>
<p>The case system of English is so impoverished by now that it isn’t
very interesting to look at. But many languages have a much richer case
morphology, and case syncretism is a common occurrence in those
languages. This is shown below for Latin <em>rex</em> ‘king’, where
nominative and accusative are syncretic in the plural, as are dative and
ablative.</p>

<p>As with person pronoun paradigms and adjectival gradation, some
conceivable case syncretisms never show up in any language. For
instance, there is no language with the following variant of the plural
case paradigm for ‘rex’:</p>

<p>Why is this impossible? It can’t be just because three cases are
syncretic, because we’ve seen that this is fine in Icelandic. So why
does no language like to have a case paradigm of this form? Again we are
forced to explain some typological gaps, and again monotonicity provides
an answer.</p>
<div class="exercise">

<p>Unless you’re a native speaker of one of those languages, you will

your local library, or an online resource like Wikipedia.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="genitive-dative-and-accusative">Genitive, dative and
accusative</h2>
<p>Case systems can be very complex and convoluted, so we will only
focus on a few simple problems here. First of all, we will only consider
syncretism within a single column of the case paradigm. That is to say,
we do not worry how singular forms can be syncretic with plural forms,
we’re only interested in syncretism among case forms in the singular and
syncretism among case forms in the plural. Second, we won’t consider
each individual case that has been proposed for some language, because
there’s tons of them: ablative, locative, elative, instrumental,
benefactive, and much more. Instead, we will subsume them all under
<em>other</em> and use <strong>Blake’s case hierarchy</strong> (named
after Australian linguist Barry Blake) as our starting point.</p>
<p>Slightly truncated, Blake’s case hierarchy postulates that <span
class="math display">\[\mathrm{Nom} &lt;
\mathrm{Acc} &lt;
\mathrm{Gen} &lt;
\mathrm{Dat} &lt;
\mathrm{others}\]</span> The *ABA generalization, which we encountered
with adjectival gradation and person pronoun paradigms, can be extended
to this hierarchy, and linguists have indeed done so. But now that the
generalization applies to paradigms with more than three cells, it
receives a slightly more general interpretation: two cases <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> cannot have the same form in a paradigm
unless every case <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> that occurs
between them in the hierarchy also has this form in the paradigm.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The paradigm for Latin <em>rex</em> displays syncretism of nominative
and accusative to the exclusion of genitive, dative, and ablative. But
since these cases do not occur between nominative and accusative in
Blake’s case hierarchy, this obeys the *ABA generalization.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>The paradigm for <em>rex</em> also has syncretism of dative and
ablative in the plural. Can a monotonic function produce this pattern
from Blake’s case hierarchy? Justify your answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Barry Blake did not actually intend his case hierarchy to be used in
this manner. Instead, it was supposed to capture a particular
typological generalization: if a language has some case <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, then it also has every case such that
<span class="math inline">\(x &lt; y\)</span> in Blake’s hierarchy. Show
that this, too, can be understood as an instance of monotonicity.</p>
</div>
<p>There is a problem with the *ABA generalization, though. In many
Germanic languages, dative and accusative are syncretic to the exclusion
of genitive. But given Blake’s case hierarchy, that would be an instance
of an ABA pattern.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>In German, it is very common for nominative, dative and accusative to
take the base form, whereas genitive receives a special affix. So
<em>Papa</em> ‘dad’ could be nominative, dative, or accusative, whereas
the genitive must be <em>Papas</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>German is not an ideal example because the genitive is becoming
increasingly unproductive. Moreover, the dative allows for a special
suffix <em>-e</em> for nouns that end in a consonant, so that
<em>Mann</em> can be either <em>Mann</em> or <em>Manne</em> (although
the latter sounds very archaic). it is conceivable, then, that the
dative of <em>Papa</em> is underlyingly <em>Papae</em>, with the final
vowel subsequently deleted by some phonological process.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Show that the German case pattern for <em>Papa</em> obeys the *ABA
generalization if one makes at least one of the following
assumptions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>German has no genitive case and uses a truncated version of Blake’s
case hierarchy without genitive.</li>
<li>German has a genitive form <em>Papas</em>, but the dative is
underlyingly <em>Papae</em> rather than <em>Papa</em>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>A better example comes from the Icelandic word for <em>father</em>.
The nominative is <em>faðir</em>, its dative and accusative are
<em>föður</em>, yet the genitive is <em>föðurs</em>. And in contrast to
German, there’s no wiggle room here: these are the endings, and there
aren’t any colloquial variations. So accusative and dative are indeed
the only syncretic cases, and crucially the genitive case does not
participate in this syncretism.</p>
</div>
<p>If we combine the *ABA generalization with Blake’s hierarchy in its
current form, then we cannot produce these attested syncretism patterns.
Since genitive occurs between accusative and dative, syncretism of the
latter two the exclusion of the former necessarily generates an ABA
pattern. Either the *ABA generalization is too restrictive, or Blake’s
hierarchy is wrong. We could of course try to change the hierarchy, but
the easy options do not work.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Explain why the following hierarchy is empirically inadequate: <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Nom} &lt; \mathrm{Gen} &lt; \mathrm{Acc}
&lt; \mathrm{Dat} &lt; \mathrm{others}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Icelandic also has some nouns where nominative and genitive are
syncretic to the exclusion of dative and accusative. Which variants of
Blake’s hierarchy does this rule out?</p>
</div>
<h2 id="partial-orders-to-the-rescue">Partial orders to the rescue</h2>
<p>It seems that no matter how we order the cases, at least one attested
syncretism will violate the *ABA generalization. But perhaps we are
accidentally limiting ourselves. First of all, remember that the *ABA
generalization is just a linguistic counterpart to the mathematical
notion of monotonicity. Perhaps monotonicity provides a way out?</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Pick one of the problematic syncretisms pointed out above and explain
why it is also problematic if we replace the *ABA generalization with
the requirement that the mapping from the Blake hierarchy to surface
forms must be a monotonic function.</p>
</div>
<p>Well, monotonicity by itself doesn’t really help. But it opens up a
path toward a new solution. So far, we have implicitly assumed that
linguistic hierarchies must be <strong>trichotomous</strong>: for any
given <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, it holds that <span
class="math inline">\(x &lt; y\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(y &lt; x\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(x = y\)</span>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>If we order the natural numbers by <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, the result is a trichotomous order.
No matter which two numbers <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> we pick, we either have <span
class="math inline">\(m &lt; n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(n
&lt; m\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(m = n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now suppose that we take the set of all humans that have ever lived
and order them by the ancestor relation <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x
\mathrel{A} y\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is an
ancestor of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. The resulting order
is not trichotomous because there are at least two distinct human beings
such that neither one is the other’s ancestor.</p>
</div>
<p>Trichotomy is a natural starting point for linguistic hierarchies,
but it isn’t a necessary one. In contrast to the *ABA generalization,
monotonicity is also a meaningful concept if we consider <strong>partial
orders</strong>. In a partial order, some elements may be unordered with
respect to some other elements. This allows us to make a small but
important modification to Blake’s hierarchy: allow accusative and
genitive to be unordered with respect to each other. We can depict this
new hierarchy in the form of a graph</p>
<p><img src="blake_partialorder.svg" alt="blake_partialorder.svg" /></p>
<p>In this graph, the vertical axis corresponds to the order induced by
<span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>. The graph is, essentially,
the result of rotating Blake’ case hierarchy 90 degrees clockwise and
then rearranging accusative and genitive so that they are still between
nominative and dative but unordered with respect to each other. More
precisely, the graph encodes the following orderings of cases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Nom} &lt;
\mathrm{Acc}\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Nom} &lt;
\mathrm{Gen}\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Acc} &lt;
\mathrm{Dat}\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Gen} &lt;
\mathrm{Dat}\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Dat} &lt;
\mathrm{others}\)</span>,</li>
<li>all the orders that follow from the orders above:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Nom} &lt;
\mathrm{Dat}\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Nom} &lt;
\mathrm{others}\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Acc} &lt;
\mathrm{others}\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Gen} &lt;
\mathrm{others}\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Crucially, since genitive and accusative are now unordered with
respect to each other, monotonicity no longer applies to them.
Monotonicity is a restriction on what a function may map <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to if <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are ordered with respect to each other.
Monotonicity has nothing to say for cases where no such ordering holds.
If there is no order between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, then it does not matter whether
<span class="math inline">\(f(x) \leq f(y)\)</span> or the other way
round. Without an ordering between accusative and genitive, it becomes
possible for accusative and dative to be syncretic to the exclusion of
genitive.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose that accusative and dative are both mapped to the same
exponent, which is different from the realization of genitive: <span
class="math inline">\(f(\mathrm{Acc}) = f(\mathrm{Dat}) \neq
f(\mathrm{Gen})\)</span>. We will show that this is compatible with the
assumption of a monotonically increasing (or decreasing) function.</p>
<p>First, the revised case hierarchy above establishes that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Acc} &lt; \mathrm{Dat}\)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is monotonically increasing, then <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Acc} &lt; \mathrm{Dat}\)</span> entails
<span class="math inline">\(f(\mathrm{Acc}) \leq
f(\mathrm{Dat})\)</span>. By our initial assumption, <span
class="math inline">\(f(\mathrm{Acc}) = f(\mathrm{Dat})\)</span>, which
confirms <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathrm{Acc}) \leq
f(\mathrm{Dat})\)</span>. Our revised case hierarchy also postulates
that <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Gen} &lt;
\mathrm{Dat}\)</span>, so it must be the case that <span
class="math inline">\(f(\mathrm{Gen}) \leq f(\mathrm{Dat})\)</span>.
Whether this holds depends on how one orders the surface forms, but it
is always possible to pick an ordering that satisfies <span
class="math inline">\(f(\mathrm{Gen}) \leq f(\mathrm{Dat})\)</span>.
Finally, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Acc}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Gen}\)</span> are unordered with respect
to each other, and consequently the relative order of <span
class="math inline">\(f(\mathrm{Acc})\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(f(\mathrm{Gen})\)</span> is irrelevant for
monotonicity.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following syncretisms, state whether it can be
realized by a monotonic mapping assuming the modified Blake hierarchy
where accusative and genitive are unordered with respect to each other.
If necessary, you may assume a different linear order of output forms
for each syncretism. Justify your answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Syncretism of nominative and genitive to the exclusion of

<p>It seems, then, that monotonicity does a lot of work even in the
richer domain of case syncretisms. The crucial step is to move from a
total order to a partial order.</p>

<ul>
<li>Linguists often assume that hierarchies are
<strong>trichotomous</strong>: all elements of the hierarchy must be
ordered with respect to each other.</li>
<li>If we drop the trichotomy requirement, linguistic hierarchies can be
<strong>partial orders</strong>.</li>
<li>In contrast to linguistic proposals like the No-Crossing-Branches
constraint or the *ABA generalization, monotonicity isn’t limited to
trichotomous orders. It works just as well for partial orders.</li>
<li>This makes it possible to explain highly distinct linguistic
phenomena as the result of two interacting factors: the formal universal
of monotonicity that holds across many domains of language, and
domain-specific substantive universals, each one of which takes the form
of a linear order (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(1 &lt; 2 &lt;
3\)</span> for pronouns or <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{positive}
