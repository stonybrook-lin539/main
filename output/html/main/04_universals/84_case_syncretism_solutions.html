<div class="exercise">
<p>Pick one of the languages below and write down a case paradigm for a
specific word of that language. Highlight the cells that are syncretic
(if any).</p>
<ul>
<li>Ancient Greek</li>
<li>Basque</li>
<li>Finnish</li>
<li>German</li>
<li>Hungarian</li>
<li>Icelandic</li>
<li>Japanese</li>
<li>Korean</li>
<li>Old English</li>
<li>Old Norse</li>
<li>Russian</li>
<li>Sanskrit</li>
<li>Tamil</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you’re a native speaker of one of those languages, you will
have to do some research to find out how their case system works. Try
your local library, or an online resource like Wikipedia.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>I will give a boring example from German. German <em>Haus</em>
‘house’ inflects as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Nominative: <em>Haus</em></li>
<li>Accusative: <em>Haus</em></li>
<li>Genitive: <em>Hauses</em></li>
<li>Dative: <em>Haus</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Nominative, accusative, and dative are syncretic to the exclusion of
genitive.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>The paradigm for <em>rex</em> also has syncretism of dative and
ablative in the plural. Can a monotonic function produce this pattern
from Blake’s case hierarchy? Justify your answer.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>Ablative falls under the <em>others</em> category. There is no other
case between <em>Dat</em> and <em>others</em>. A monotonic function may
always map two cases to the same form as long as there is no other case
between the two that gets mapped to a different form. Hence syncretism
of dative and ablative is not problematic.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Barry Blake did not actually intend his case hierarchy to be used in
this manner. Instead, it was supposed to capture a particular
typological generalization: if a language has some case <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, then it also has every case such that
<span class="math inline">\(x &lt; y\)</span> in Blake’s hierarchy. Show
that this, too, can be understood as an instance of monotonicity.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>We can conceptualize every language as a function <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> from Blake’s hierarchy to the values
<span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(f(x)
= 1\)</span> means that the language has case <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(x) =
0\)</span> means that it does not. Let us assume <span
class="math inline">\(0 &lt; 1\)</span> as usual. Then Blake’s
generalization can be restated as follows: if <span
class="math inline">\(x &lt; y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(f(y) = 1\)</span>, then it must also hold that
<span class="math inline">\(f(x) = 1\)</span>. Let us generalize this
statement even more. Since the only two possible values are <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f(x) =
1\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \geq 1 =
f(y)\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \geq f(y)\)</span>.
And if we do not explicitly assume that <span class="math inline">\(x
\neq y\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(x &lt; y\)</span>
should be rewritten as <span class="math inline">\(x \leq y\)</span>.
This leaves us with the following claim: if <span
class="math inline">\(x \leq y\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) \geq f(y)\)</span>. But that’s exactly the
definition of a monotonic decreasing function.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Explain why the following hierarchy is empirically inadequate: <span
class="math inline">\(\text{Nom} &lt; \text{Gen} &lt; \text{Acc} &lt;
\text{Dat} &lt; \text{others}\)</span>.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>This hierarchy predicts that nominative and accusative can never be
syncretic to the exclusion of genitive, but we find tons of languages
that do that, including the German example of <em>Haus</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Icelandic also has some nouns where nominative and genitive are
syncretic to the exclusion of dative and accusative. Which variants of
Blake’s hierarchy does this rule out?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>This argues against any variant of the hierarchy where accusative or
dative occur between nominative and genitive.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Pick one of the problematic syncretisms pointed out above and explain
why it is also problematic if we replace the <span
class="math inline">\(^*\)</span>ABA generalization with the requirement
that the mapping from the Blake hierarchy to surface forms must be a
monotonic function.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>Consider the Icelandic case of syncretism of Accusative and Dative.
We have <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathrm{Acc}) = f(\mathrm{Dat}) =
A \neq B = f(\mathrm{Gen})\)</span>. Suppose w.l.o.g. that <span
class="math inline">\(A &lt; B\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not monotonically increasing because
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Gen} \leq \text{Dat}\)</span> yet
<span class="math inline">\(f(\text{Gen}) &gt; f(\text{Dat})\)</span>.
But <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not monotonically
decreasing either because <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Acc} \leq
\text{Gen}\)</span> yet <span class="math inline">\(f(\text{Acc}) &lt;
f(\text{Gen})\)</span>.</p>

<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following syncretisms, state whether it can be
realized by a monotonic mapping assuming the modified Blake hierarchy
(if necessary, you may assume a different linear order of output forms
for each syncretism). Justify your answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Syncretism of nominative and genitive to the exclusion of
accusative</li>
<li>Syncretism of nominative and dative to the exclusion of
accusative</li>
<li>Syncretism of nominative, accusative, and dative to the exclusion of
genitive</li>
<li>Syncretism of nominative, accusative, and genitive to the exclusion
of dative</li>
<li>Syncretism of accusative and genitive to the exclusion of nominative
and dative</li>
</ul>
<div class="solution">
<ol type="1">
<li>Yes, because accusative does not occur between nominative and
genitive.</li>
<li>No, because accusative occurs between nominative and dative.</li>
<li>No, because genitive occurs between nominative and dative (this
might suggest that German dative does indeed always have an <em>e</em>
which is removed for phonological reasons, so we don’t have true
syncretism of all three cases there).</li>
<li>Yes, because nominative, accusative, and genitive are all less than
dative.</li>
<li>Yes. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(f(\text{Nom}) = A\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(f(\text{Acc}) = f(\text{Gen}) = B\)</span>,
and <span class="math inline">\(f(\text{Dat}) = C\)</span>. This is a
monotonic map if <span class="math inline">\(A &lt; B &lt;
C\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="solution_explained">
<p>The important thing to keep in mind here is the following fact: if
<span class="math inline">\(x \leq y \leq z\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> cannot be monotonic if <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) = f(z) \neq f(y)\)</span>. Because <span
class="math inline">\(x \leq y \leq z\)</span> implies that both <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) \leq f(y)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(f(y) \leq f(z)\)</span> hold, and the only way to
satisfy this if <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = f(z)\)</span> is for
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to be mapped to the same output
as <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. Hence we cannot have syncretism of two
cases <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> to the exclusion of some other case
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> between the two.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Actually, this insight was already implicit in the unit on NPIs,
where we looked at the distribution of <em>ever</em>. What was the
partial order that we used in this case?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>It was the subset relation between sets. This is not a linear order.
For instance, <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ b \right \}\)</span> are both
subsets of <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b \right \}\)</span>,
but (assuming <span class="math inline">\(a \neq b\)</span>) <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right \}\)</span> is not a subset of
<span class="math inline">\(\left \{ b \right \}\)</span>, nor the other
way round.</p>
