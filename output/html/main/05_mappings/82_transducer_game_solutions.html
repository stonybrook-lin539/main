<p>How would the game have ended if Mary had decided to go with option 2
instead: place nothing and player 2 gets the next turn. What would have
been the sequence on the output token tray, assuming that John does not
use his special power at all?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>John has placed a heart on the output token tray and given the next
turn to Mary. She draws spade and decides to go with option 2, placing
nothing and giving the turn to John. So now it is John who draws heart,
once more placing heart and giving the next turn to Mary. Mary draws ⋉.
Mary is not a final player, and the game is lost. Since the game is
lost, the output token tray is cleared and no output is produced. If the
game had been won, the output token tray would have been
<em>heart-heart</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>This continues the previous exercise. What if Mary’s rule sheet also
contained the special power below? Would there be a way to use this rule
and finish the game?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Special power:</strong> Instead of drawing an input token,
place a diamond. Player 2 gets the next turn.</li>
</ul>
<div class="solution">
<p>Suppose that instead of drawing from the bag, which will result in ⋉,
Mary uses her special power. She places diamond and John gets the next
turn. John draws ⋉, but this is okay because he’s a final player. The
sequence of tokens on the output token tray is
<em>heart-heart-diamond</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>This one is just for fun: think about ways to spruce up this basic
gameplay loop. If you end up with something fun, get it published and
donate some of the proceeds to the cause of mathematical
linguistics.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>Modern board games have tons of intricate mechanics, e.g. bidding,
action selection, deck building, or worker placement. The problem with
the current game is that there isn’t much strategy because of the random
draw of input tokens. It’s more like a game for toddlers, teaching
turn-taking and the how to follow instructions. In order to make this a
real game, there needs to be tension, conflicting goals, and
uncertainty.</p>
<p>Here is my proposal, which still needs playtesting: The game stays
exactly the way described above, but there are multiple rounds. In the
example above, Mary and John played only one round. After drawing ⋉,
they tally up their score so far, then play again. At the end of, say, 5
rounds, they check their total score. The goal is to get as high a score
as possible. But here’s the twist: the players do not know each other’s
rules and powers, and they may not talk to each other. Now this is a
hidden information game where you have to learn each other’s rules on
the fly over multiple rounds, and you need to be a well-oiled machine to
get high scores.</p>
<p>It’s still a pretty dry game — no witty banter, no take-that moments,
no victory condition beyond beating your own high score — but at least
it’s an actual game now. Let’s try to make it a bit juicier: secret
player objectives! Rather then going for a single high score for all the
players, every player has a list of secret objectives that they need to
reach over the course of the game, e.g. “at the end of the round, gain 2
victory points if the output token tray contains the sequence
heart-heart-heart”. At the end of the game, the player with the most
victory points wins. Now this is a semi-coop design: every player is
pursuing their own goals, but there’s still the shared goal of winning
each round because nobody can meet their objectives with an empty output
token tray (however, depending on whether players know each other’s
victory points, there might be a strategy to deliberately sabotage a
round in order to stay in the lead). It would be difficult to balance
the secret objectives and special powers, but a good designer could make
it work. And the outcome would be something that I’d actually like to
play!</p>

<div class="exercise">
<p>Expand this table so that it also includes the special power of
player 1 from the exercise above (instead of drawing an input token,
place a diamond and player 2 gets the next turn).</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>We have to add <em>nothing:diamond</em> to the cell in the row for
Player 1 and the column for Player 2.</p>
