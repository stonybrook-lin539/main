n-grams to mappings: a failed attempt (Solutions)</h1>
<div class="exercise">
<p>The English plural marker has multiple forms that are phonologically
conditioned. Roughly speaking, we get</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>es</em> after <em>s</em>, <em>z</em>, <em>ʃ</em>, and
<em>tʃ</em>,</li>
<li><em>s</em> after any other voiceless consonants (e.g. <em>t</em>,
<em>k</em>),</li>
<li><em>z</em> everywhere else (that is to say, after vowels and voiced
consonants).</li>
</ol>
<p>Assume that a form like <em>gases</em> is underlyingly <em>gasP</em>,
where P is a single abstract symbol indicating plural. Provide a list of
n-grams that rewrite P as the correct surface form. For simplicity, you
may assume that the alphabet only consists of <em>g</em>, <em>s</em>,
<em>t</em>, <em>a</em>, and <em>e</em>.</p>
<div class="solution">
<ol type="1">
<li>sP[es]</li>
<li>tP[s]</li>
<li>gP[z], aP[z], eP[z]</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="solution_explained">
<p>Since the realization of the plural is conditioned by the preceding
segment, we only need bigrams to capture its distribution. The
stipulated alphabet contains only <em>s</em>, which matches the first
condition above, <em>t</em>, which matches the second condition above,
and <em>g</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>e</em>, which match the third condition
above.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Specify the mapping n-grams for intervocalic voicing. You may assume
that the alphabet only consists of <em>a</em>, <em>o</em>, <em>s</em>,
<em>z</em>, and <em>l</em>.</p>
<div class="solution">
<ul>
<li>as[z]a</li>
<li>as[z]o</li>
<li>os[z]a</li>
<li>os[z]o</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="solution_explained">
<p>Intervocalic voicing only targets voiceless segments, and <em>s</em>
is the only voiceless segment in the stipulated alphabet. A segment is
voiced only if both the preceding and the following segment is a vowel,
and thus we have to use trigrams instead of bigrams.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Matching n-grams also run into issues with unbounded processes like
sibilant harmony. Suppose that <em>s</em> becomes <em>ʃ</em> after
<em>ʃ</em>, no matter how far the two are apart. For instance,
<em>ʃtojowonowas</em> would become <em>ʃtojowonowaʃ</em>. Explain why
this cannot be handled with matching n-grams if the number of
intervening segments is truly unbounded.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>The problem is pretty much the same we encountered with the
phonotactics of unbounded sibilant harmony: n-grams only allow us to
capture dependencies that span up to <em>n</em> segments. If there truly
is no upper bound on how far the sibilants can be apart, then no value
<em>n</em> is ever sufficient to cover all cases. If, on the other hand,
we assume that there is an upper bound but it’s simply very large, then
we run into the problem of having a very, very large grammar that fails
to capture the phenomenon succinctly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Continuing the previous exercise, suggest a way matching n-grams
could be amended to handle such unbounded dependencies.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>Just as in the case of phonotactics, we could project a tier and use
the matching n-grams over this sibilant tier instead of the whole
string. Then sibilant harmony would be captured by the bigrams ʃs[ʃ] and
sʃ[s]. In contrast to what we saw with phonotactics, though, this would
still fail to handle cases with multiple sibilants. For instance, if the
sibilant tier is <em>ʃss</em>, then the first <em>s</em> would be
correctly rewritten as <em>ʃ</em>, but the second <em>s</em> would not
change because it is preceded by <em>s</em> — the rewriting of
<em>s</em> as <em>ʃ</em> does not trigger the same rewriting step on
subsequent segments. This is another case where we would have to define
the match over the surface form of the UR. Hence we would need tiers
over surface forms for this phenomenon, rather than tiers over URs.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Suppose you are given the following mapping n-grams.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>n[m]p</li>
<li>mp[<span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>]</li>
<li>a[a:]mp</li>
<li>a:[a]⋉</li>
</ol>
<p>Which of the following are URs from which one can obtain the surface
form <em>a:mpa</em>? Assume that the mapping n-grams must match the UR,
not the surface form or something else.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ampa:</li>
<li>ampa</li>
<li>a:mpa:</li>
<li>a:mpa</li>
<li>anpa:</li>
<li>anpa</li>
<li>a:npa:</li>
<li>a:npa</li>
</ol>
<div class="solution">
<p>The surface form <em>a:mpa</em> can be obtained from the following
two URs in the list, and only those:</p>
<ul>
<li>a:npa:</li>
<li>a:npa</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="solution_explained">
<ol type="1">
<li>ampa: becomes a:ma because of mp[<span

in mind that each one of them only considers the UR, not the forms
obtained by applications of matching n-grams)</li>
