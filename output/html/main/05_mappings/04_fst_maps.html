as transductions</h1>
<p>We have spent a fair amount of time on FSTs by now, but we still
haven’t seen a truly compelling reason for using them as a formal model
of phonology. So far, our only observation has been that FSTs allow us
to rewrite one string into another, which would allow us to relate
underlying representations (URs) in phonology to their corresponding
surface forms. But this is really underselling FSTs as a model of
phonology. What is impressive about FSTs is that they use a single core
mechanic — connecting finitely many states via transitions that have
input:output labels — yet get tremendous phonological mileage out of it.
FSTs can handle local processes like assimilation and word-final
devoicing, iterated local processes like vowel harmony, unbounded
dependencies and tiers, blocking, rule ordering, and much more. They
truly are a phonological swiss army knife, except that it is a swiss
army knife that does everything with just one blade.</p>
<h2 id="progressive-assimilation">Progressive assimilation</h2>
<p>Let us start with a very simple example. In colloquial speech,
<em>n</em> often is pronounced <em>m</em> immediately after <em>p</em>.
For example, somebody might say <em>cap’m</em> instead of <em>cap’n</em>
as the short form of <em>captain</em>. This is an instance of
<strong>progressive assimilation</strong>. Phonologists would describe
this with a <strong>rewrite rule</strong> of the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{n} \rightarrow \mathrm{m} \mid
\mathrm{p} \_\]</span></p>
<p>which is read as “<em>n</em> becomes <em>m</em> in any context where
<em>n</em> immediately appears to the right of <em>p</em>”.
Specifically, the rule has a left half and right half, separated by the
pipe symbol <code>|</code>. The left half tells us what sound changes in
what manner, and the right half tells us the context, with the
underscore <code>_</code> representing the position of the sound
undergoing the change. Rewrite rules of this form are very common in the
phonological literature and are also used in morphology (word
structure).</p>
<p>We can also express this progressive assimilation very easily in the
form of an FST. Again we may use the tabular format or the graph-based
one in order to specify the FST. For the sake of succinctness, we assume
that the only input symbols are <em>m</em>, <em>n</em>, <em>p</em>, and
<em>x</em>. A realistic FST would have many more input symbols, but they
would all be treated exactly the same as <em>x</em> here.</p>

<p>This transducer leaves almost all input symbols unchanged. If it sees
a <em>p</em>, it moves into the state <em>P</em>, and only at this
point, if the next symbol it sees is <em>n</em>, does it do some
rewriting and output <em>m</em> instead. The key strategy is to switch
from the default state <em>0</em> to the special state <em>P</em> when
the conditions for rewriting <em>n</em> as <em>m</em> are met. Once we
are in the state, we go back to <em>0</em> the moment the conditions for
assimilation are no longer met, either because we have already carried
out the assimilation step, or because we have encountered other input
symbols that have disrupted the conditions for assimilation.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the URs below, compute the corresponding surface form
generated by the FST for progressive assimilation above. Don’t forget to

<p>Many language do not like consonant clusters of three or more
consonants in a row. Using the strategy illustrated above, construct an
FST that deletes all consonants in a cluster except the first two. For
the sake of simplicity, assume that the input alphabet only consists of
C for consonants and V for vowels. For example, you may have the input
string CCVCCCCV, and it should be rewritten as CCVCCV.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="the-challenges-of-regressive-assimilation">The challenges of
regressive assimilation</h2>
<p>Whereas progressive assimilation proceeds from left-to-right,
<strong>regressive assimilation</strong> proceeds from right-to-left.
For example, the word <em>white board</em> is commonly pronounced like
<em>wipe board</em> because the <em>b</em> in <em>board</em> causes the
preceding <em>t</em> in <em>white</em> to become a <em>p</em>. The
rewrite rule for that would be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{t} \rightarrow \mathrm{p} \mid
\_ \mathrm{b}\]</span></p>
<p>Notice how the conditioning environment now occurs after the sound
that undergoes assimilation. At first sight it may seem that our FST
cannot handle regressive assimilation patterns. Since the FST moves
through the input from left-to-right and does not get to look ahead, it
does not know what to do when it encounters a <em>t</em>. Maybe it will
be followed by a <em>b</em>, in which case it should be rewritten as
<em>p</em>, or maybe <em>t</em> won’t be followed by <em>b</em>, in
which case it should stay a <em>t</em>. How could the FST figure out
which one is the right option?</p>
<p>There are three different ways to handle this, and we will look at
each one in turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switching to a non-deterministic FST</li>
<li>Running the FST from right to left instead</li>
<li>Using the <strong>delayed output strategy</strong> with
<strong>final emissions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The first solution uses a non-deterministic FST. Recall that an FST
is non-deterministic iff there are choice points. This can be because
there are multiple initial states or multiple applicable transitions.
And it is total iff it produces an output for every input string. Below
is a non-deterministic FST that correctly rewrites <em>t</em> as
<em>p</em> before <em>b</em>.</p>

<p>This transducer provides a choice point when we are in state 0 and
encounter <em>t</em>: we may keep <em>t</em> as <em>t</em> and switch
into state <em>T</em>, or we may rewrite <em>t</em> as <em>p</em> and
switch into state <em>P</em>. Notice that state <em>T</em> has no
outgoing transition with <em>b</em> as an input symbol. So if the next
input symbol is indeed <em>b</em> and the transducer is in state
<em>T</em>, then it gets stuck. This enforces that <em>t</em> cannot
stay <em>t</em> when followed by <em>b</em>. By contrast, state
<em>P</em> only has one outgoing transition which must have <em>b</em>
as its input symbol. So if the transducer decides to rewrite <em>t</em>
as <em>p</em> but there is no <em>b</em> after <em>t</em>, the
transducer once again gets stuck. This ensures that <em>t</em> must be
rewritten as <em>p</em> when followed by <em>b</em>. Taken together, we
get that <em>t</em> is rewritten as <em>p</em> iff it is followed by
<em>b</em>, which is exactly what the rewrite rule says.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the URs below, compute the corresponding surface form

</div>
<p>We can conclude, then, that regressive assimilation can be handled
with non-deterministic FSTs, but that’s no exactly surprising because
non-deterministic FSTs are a lot more powerful than total deterministic
FSTs. Ideally, we make do with the latter as much as possible.
Fortunately we have two more options for handling regressive
assimilation, and those allow us to keep the FST total and
deterministic.</p>
<p>Consider then the second option, which is to simply change the
direction in which the FST processes the string. Rather than moving
through the input from left to right, the transducer moves through it
from right to left. In this case the FST always knows whether <em>t</em>
is followed by <em>b</em> because it sees the symbol immediately to the
right of <em>t</em> <strong>before</strong> it encounters <em>t</em>,
rather than afterwards. For an FST moving from right-to-left, regressive
assimilation is just progressive assimilation.</p>
<p>We can make this fully explicit in formal terms by treating
right-to-left transducers as left-to-right transducers with a string
reversal operation. A right-to-left FST works as follows: mirror the
input, run the left-to-right FST, then mirror the output.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p>Given an FST <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, the
corresponding <strong>right-to-left</strong> FST <span
class="math inline">\(T_{R2L}\)</span> maps input string <span
class="math inline">\(i_1 \cdots i_m{\ltimes}\)</span> to output string
<span class="math inline">\(o_1 \cdots o_n\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> maps <span class="math inline">\(i_m
\cdots i_1 {\ltimes}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(o_n \cdots

</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider once more the (deterministic and total) FST for progressive
assimilation of <em>n</em> to <em>m</em> after <em>p</em>. When reading
the input from left to right, it maps <em>xnpn⋉</em> to <em>xnpm</em>.
In right-to-left mode, on the other hand, it rewrites <em>xnpn⋉</em> as
<em>xmpn</em> because from that direction, it is the left <em>n</em>
that is encountered after <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>Here is how this follows from the definition above:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Let us use <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> to refer to the
progressive assimilation transducer. Its right-to-left counterpart is

<li><span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> maps <em>npnx⋉</em> to

generates from the input <em>xnpn⋉</em>.</li>
<li>Overall, <span class="math inline">\(T_{R2L}\)</span> maps
<em>xnpn⋉</em> to <em>xmpn⋉</em>, which is a case of regressive

class="math inline">\(T_{R2L}\)</span> captures the regressive

</div>
<p>This account says that progressive and regressive assimilation are
fundamentally the same mechanism, they only differ in whether one
processes the string left-to-right or right-to-left. Still, sometimes it
is helpful to have all transducers operate left-to-right, so let us look
at our third solution, which keeps the FST deterministic, total, and
left-to-right. Rather than having the left-to-right FST make a
non-deterministic guess about whether the current <em>t</em> should be
rewritten as <em>t</em> or <em>p</em>, we can make it hold off on the
rewriting until more of the input string has been seen. This is the
<strong>delayed output strategy</strong>, and it exploits the fact that
the output of a transition does not have to be exactly one symbol — it
can also be the empty string or a string of two or more output
symbols.</p>

<p>This deterministic FST deletes <em>t</em> upon encountering it, but
it switches to a different state <em>T</em> to keep track of the fact
that a <em>t</em> has been deleted. When it encounters a <em>b</em>, a
<em>p</em>, or an <em>x</em>, the transducer transitions from <em>T</em>
back to the default state <em>0</em>. However, in doing so it also
reinserts the deleted <em>t</em>, or rather, <em>t</em> or <em>p</em>
depending on the symbol: with <em>p</em> and <em>x</em>, the deleted
<em>t</em> is reinserted, whereas with <em>b</em>, a <em>p</em> is
reinserted instead. Hence a <em>t</em> followed by a <em>b</em>
undergoes assimilation to <em>p</em> via a two-step procedure: deletion
of <em>t</em> and rewriting of <em>b</em> as <em>pb</em>. And this
two-step procedure is exactly what the delayed output strategy is
about.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the URs below, compute the corresponding surface form
generated by the FST above that uses the delayed output strategy. Don’t
forget to add ⋉ at the end of the input string.</p>

<div class="exercise">
<p>What is the role of the transition <em>t:t</em> from state <em>T</em>
to <em>T</em>?</p>
</div>
<p>One important but easily missed part of this FST is the final
transition for <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Here, ⋉ is
rewritten as <em>t</em>. This is absolutely vital in ensuring that the
delayed output strategy does not accidentally drop <em>t</em> at the end
of the string.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the UR <em>xt</em>, which corresponds to the input string
<em>xt⋉</em>. The transducer starts in state <em>0</em>, rewrites
<em>x</em> as <em>x</em>, and transitions to state <em>0</em>. After
that, it sees <em>t</em> in the input and transitions from <em>0</em> to
<em>T</em> while outputting nothing. So at this point the output string
consists only of <em>x</em>. The FST then reads in <em>⋉</em>, outputs
<em>t</em>, and then stops. The previously deleted <em>t</em> is
reinserted and the overall output is <em>xt</em>, as desired. If the FST
had not rewritten <em>⋉</em> as <em>t</em>, the output would have been
<em>x</em>, which is incorrect.</p>
</div>
<p>Outputs produced by rewriting ⋉ are also called <strong>final
emissions</strong>. When dealing with phonological rewrite rules, the
delayed output strategy often requires the use of final emissions to
make sure that sounds aren’t accidentally deleted at the end of the
word.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>In a previous chapter, we encountered the process of word-final
devoicing in German. Inspired by this phenomenon, define two separate
FSTs that replace word-final <em>z</em> with <em>s</em> and word-final
<em>v</em> with <em>f</em>. One transducer should operate right-to-left,
the other one should use the delayed output strategy in combination with
final emissions.</p>
<p>For each FST, you may write a table or draw a graph.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>The process of intervocalic voicing is also familiar from an earlier
chapter. Suppose that <em>s</em> is subject to intervocalic voicing::
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{s} \rightarrow \mathrm{z} \mid
\mathrm{V} \_ \mathrm{V}\)</span>. You may assume that the only input
symbols are <em>s</em>, <em>z</em>, <em>x</em>, and <em>V</em> (and of
course ⋉). Define an FST for intervocalic voicing. You may write a table
or draw a graph.</p>
<p>Does your FST use the delayed output strategy? What about the final
emission trick?</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Continuing the previous exercise, answer the following question: Can
intervocalic voicing be captured by a (total, deterministic)
right-to-left transducer without the delayed output strategy? Justify
your answer.</p>

<h2 id="iterativityspreading-for-vowel-harmony">Iterativity/spreading
for vowel harmony</h2>
<p>Another process we are familiar with by now is vowel harmony. We
described Korean vowel harmony as a ban against mixing bright vowels (B)
and mid-dark vowels (M) in the same word. But at least some types of
vowel harmony aren’t just constraints on what vowels may be combined,
they are processes that change non-harmonic vowels in the UR to harmonic
vowels in the surface form.</p>
<p>Consider then a variant of Korean where vowel harmony causes
non-harmonic vowels to be replaced by harmonic counterparts. If the
first vowel is B, all other vowels in the word become B, and if the
first vowel is M, all other vowels in the word become M. Can we do this
with an FST? Why yes, of course we can, just see below (assuming that
our only input symbols are <em>B</em>, <em>M</em>, and <em>x</em> for
anything else).</p>

<p>This FST starts out in the default state <em>0</em>, but the very
first time it encounters <em>B</em> or <em>M</em>, it switches into the
corresponding state. Once it is in one of those states, it rewrites all
vowels into harmonic vowels. Notice how this FST correctly captures the
iterative nature of vowel harmony: changing one vowel to a harmonic form
causes the next one to also undergo this change. Each change is local in
that it is triggered by the preceding vowel, but the process applies
over and over again to spread the harmony across arbitrarily many
vowels.</p>

<p>Another harmony process we have encountered before is sibilant
harmony in Samala, which was noteworthy because it seems to be able to
span arbitrary distances. All sibilants in the word must be harmonic:
they are either all <em>s</em>, or they are all <em>ʃ</em>, no matter
how far apart they are from each other. When we first encountered this
phenomenon, we modeled it with tiers, but no such addition is needed for
FSTs to capture the unbounded nature of sibilant harmony.</p>
<p>Consider what sibilant harmony would look like as a process that
causes sibilants to change their form. Suppose that the harmony is
controlled by the first sibilant in the word (spoilers: this is not how
it works for Samala). If the first sibilant is <em>s</em>, then any
subsequent instances of <em>ʃ</em> become <em>s</em>. And if the first
sibilant is <em>ʃ</em>, then any subsequent instances of <em>s</em>
become <em>ʃ</em>. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the corresponding FST looks
almost the same as the one for vowel harmony.</p>

<p>Slovenian has a version of sibilant harmony that is similar to Samala
but harmony is blocked by an intervening <em>t</em>. That is to say, the
first sibilant after a <em>t</em> does not need to be harmonic with any
of the sibilants to its left, but the sibilants to its right must be
harmonic with that sibilant (unless another <em>t</em> intervenes).
Hence we get the following mappings between URs and surface forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>xxsxxʃ</em> becomes <em>xxsxxs</em></li>
<li><em>xxstxʃ</em> becomes <em>xxstxʃ</em></li>

<p>We could still look at many other phenomena, but the central point
should be clear by now: the simple and elegant mechanism of connecting
states via transitions allows us to capture wide range of phonological
phenomena. No extra tweaks or extensions are required to capture
locality, unboundedness, iterativity, tiers, blocking, and much more.
They are all particular instantiations of the same basic machinery.</p>

<p>Many languages not only use different sounds but also different
tones, e.g. high tone H and low tone L. Some of those languages have a
process known as unbounded tone plateauing: a low tone that occurs
inside an interval spanned by two high tones becomes a high tone, no
matter how far apart those high tones are. As a rewrite rule, this could
be represented as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mathrm{L} \rightarrow \mathrm{H} \mid
\mathrm{H} \ldots \_ \ldots \mathrm{H}\]</span></p>

<p>Give a non-deterministic FST that correctly handles unbounded tone
plateauing.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>This continues the previous exercise. Total deterministic FSTs cannot
handle <strong>circumambient</strong> phenomena such as unbounded tone
plateauing, where changing a segment requires a trigger to the left and
a trigger to the right and both triggers may be arbitrarily far away.
This holds irrespective of whether they operate left-to-right or
right-to-left, and irrespective of whether one uses delayed outputs
and/or final emissions. Explain why!</p>

<ul>
<li>FSTs allow us model a variety of phonological phenomena as the
rewriting of URs into surface forms.</li>
<li>Total deterministic FSTs are weaker than non-deterministic FSTs, but
they nonetheless can handle a large variety of phenomena:
<ul>
<li>locally bounded phenomena (progressive and regressive), and</li>
<li>unbounded phenomena/tier-based phenomena (progressive and
regressive), and</li>
<li>iterative phenomena and spreading, and</li>
<li>phenomena that involve blocking.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some phenomena require total deterministic FSTs that operate
<strong>right-to-left</strong> instead of left-to-right.</li>
<li>Some phenomena require the <strong>delayed output strategy</strong>:
delete the symbol, then reinsert it later on when the conditioning
context has been fully read in. This only works if there is a fixed
upper bound on how long the output has to be delayed.</li>
<li>The delayed output strategy often has to be used in conjunction with
<strong>final emissions</strong>, which rewrite ⋉ as a sequence of 0 or
more input symbols.</li>
