<h1 id="n-gram-models-of-grammaticality">N-gram models of
grammaticality</h1>
<p>This unit presents a very simple model of language. As you will see,
even simple models can give rise to complex questions, questions that
cannot easily be answered without math. It might not look like the math
you know from high school, but it is still math (some might say it is
the high school math that barely qualifies as math because it is about
calculating rather than reasoning).</p>
<p>If you already have some mathematical experience, you might want to
skip two sections ahead and only come back here to see the linguistic
motivation for the mathematics. And the trained linguist may find some
of the content here overly simplistic, but we will move on to more
intricate problems as our mathematical toolkit grows.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-fact-about-english">A simple fact about English</h2>
<p>English has a large number of different sounds, but not all
combinations are possible. For instance, <em>blink</em> is a word but
<em>kbinl</em> is not. And <em>kbinl</em> will never be a word of
English because it does not obey English <strong>phonotactics</strong>,
i.e. the laws that govern the sequence of sounds. This is what separates
<em>kbinl</em> from <em>kobinal</em> or <em>karbinolium</em>. None of
them are existing words of English, but <em>kobinal</em> and
<em>karbinolium</em> are potential words. We can give them a meaning,
start using them, and no native speaker of English will have a problem
picking them up. These words obey the phonotactic laws of English,
whereas <em>kbinl</em> violates the requirement that English words
cannot start with <em>kb</em>.</p>
<p>The knowledge of English phonotactics is what allows native speakers
to coin new terms that fit in with the rest of the vocabulary. It is
also what makes it hard for English speakers to learn other languages.
German, for example, is very happy to start a word with <em>k</em> and
<em>n</em>, as in <em>Knoblauch</em>, the German word for garlic.
English has words that are spelled with <em>kn</em> at the start, like
<em>knight</em>, but the <em>k</em> is never pronounced. In terms of
pronunciation, <em>knight</em> and <em>night</em> are the same word, and
a native speaker of English would never pronounce <em>knight</em> with a
<em>k</em> at the beginning. Phonotactics is one of the most basic
aspects of natural language. By natural language I mean languages like
English, Chinese, Tongan, Inuktitut, various dialects of Italian, or the
specific language that you grew up with. This is in contrast to formal
languages, which includes languages designed by humans (e.g. Esperanto,
Klingon, Quenya), programming languages like Python or Brainfuck (yes,
seriously), or the strands of DNA in your body (yes, we can describe
that mathematically as a particular kind of language). Linguists seek to
gain a deeper understanding of the laws, principles, and regularities of
natural languages, and this includes the laws of natural language
phonotactics. Linguists want to do this at both the language-specific
level and across languages, and this yields very different questions
even if we consider just phonotactics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language specific</strong>: What are the phonotactics of
English? German? Language X?</li>
<li><strong>General</strong>: What is a possible phonotactic system?
What shape can the laws of phonotactics take? What kind of logically
conceivable systems of phonotactics can never occur in a natural
language?</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to tackle these questions in a precise manner, we need a
formal model of phonotactics. What might that be? One plausible
assumption is that a word is phonotactically well-formed iff none of its
subparts are ill-formed. So <em>kobinal</em> is a possible word because
there is nothing wrong with a word that starts with <em>kobina</em>, has
<em>obina</em> in the middle, and ends with <em>obinal</em>. But this
just raises the question why <em>kobina</em> is an acceptable start, and
<em>obina</em> is a well-formed middle, and <em>obinal</em> is an
acceptable end. Well, because their subparts are fine. For example,
<em>kobina</em> is fine because a word can start with <em>kobin</em> and
have <em>obin</em> in the middle and <em>bina</em> at the end. Then why
can a word start with <em>kobin</em>? Well, because its subparts are
fine: a word can start with <em>kobi</em>, have <em>obi</em> in the
middle, and <em>obin</em> at the end. As you can already see, we can
play that game for a long time, breaking well-formed parts into smaller
well-formed parts.</p>
<p>But eventually, things will break down. If we want to know why
<em>ko</em> is a good start, it’s not enough to say that words can start
with <em>k</em> and have <em>o</em> in the middle. Because it is also
true that words can start with <em>k</em> and have <em>b</em> in the
middle (as in <em>kobinal</em>), yet <em>kbinal</em> is not okay even
though it starts with <em>k</em> and has a <em>b</em> in the middle. By
looking at individual sounds, we have decomposed things too much to
capture the phonotactics of English. So let’s take one step up and
consider pairs of consecutive sounds. In more technical terms, let’s
describe English phonotactics in terms of <strong>bigrams</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="bigrams">Bigrams</h2>
<h3 id="extracting-bigrams">Extracting bigrams</h3>
<p>A bigram is a string of two elements. For phonotactics, the elements
are sounds (to all trained linguists: we do not need to distinguish
between phones, allophones, or phonemes yet, so please don’t get your
panties in a twist). Examples of bigrams include <em>ko</em>,
<em>ob</em>, or <em>bn</em>. A given word’s <strong>set of
bigrams</strong> is the collection of all bigrams that occur in it,
without repetitions.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The bigrams of <em>kobinal</em> are <em>ko</em>, <em>ob</em>,
<em>bi</em>, <em>in</em>, <em>na</em>, and <em>al</em>. The bigrams of
<em>banana</em> are <em>ba</em>, <em>an</em>, and <em>na</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Consider the word <em>supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</em>. For
each one of the following, say whether it is a bigram of the word.</p>
<ul>
<li>fr</li>
<li>z</li>
<li>doci</li>
<li>pail</li>
<li>sit</li>
<li>co</li>
<li>super</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="adding-edge-markers">Adding edge markers</h3>
<p>One shortcoming of this simple notion of bigrams is that one cannot
tell which bigrams occurred at the beginning and the end of the word.
For example, <em>ababa</em> and <em>babab</em> have the same bigrams,
<em>ab</em> and <em>ba</em>.</p>
<p>But for phonotactics it is actually important to know how a word
starts and how it ends. We already saw that in our discussion of
word-initial <em>kn</em> in German. English is perfectly fine with
<em>kn</em> when it is not at the beginning of a word, e.g. in
<em>acknowledge</em>. But at the beginning of a word English
phonotactics bring out the banhammer and just won’t allow <em>kn</em>.
The beginning and the end of words seems to be privileged positions, and
our current notion of bigrams does not allow us to capture that.</p>
<p>We have to expand our notion of bigrams a bit, then. Concretely, we
will add edge markers to indicate the left or right edge of a word. One
could use a single edge marker like <em>$</em>. In that case,
<em>ababa</em> would be <em>$ababa$</em>, and <em>babab</em> would be
<em>$babab$</em>. But once we dive deeper into the mathematics, it will
be more convenient to have separate markers: ⋊ for the left edge and ⋉
for the right edge. This means that <em>ababa</em> will be
<em>⋊ababa⋉</em>, and <em>babab</em> will be <em>⋊babab⋉</em>.</p>
<p>Now one can tell clearly which sounds occurred at the start and the
end.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>To calculate the bigrams of <em>kobinal</em>, we first expand it to
<em>⋊kobinal⋉</em>. Then we extract bigrams as usual, giving us the
following list: <em>⋊k</em>, <em>ko</em>, <em>ob</em>, <em>bi</em>,
<em>in</em>, <em>na</em>, <em>al</em>, <em>l⋉</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Consider once more the word
<em>supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</em>. Which one of the following
is among its bigrams (with edge markers):</p>
<ul>
<li>fr</li>
<li>z</li>
<li>⋊⋉</li>
<li>⋊s</li>
<li>s⋉⋉</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>(For the particular observant readers: Yes, bigrams with edge markers
are still not quite enough to detect that the consonant cluster
<em>kn</em> occurred at the beginning of a word, but we will get there
soon.)</p>
<h2 id="bigram-grammars">Bigram grammars</h2>
<p>Now that we have a firm grasp of bigrams, it is actually fairly easy
to formulate our first hypothesis about natural language phonotactics:
every phonotactic system is described by a set of forbidden bigrams. If
a word contains at least one forbidden bigram, it is illicit. We call
such a collection of forbidden bigrams a <strong>negative bigram
grammar</strong>.</p>
<p>If our hypothesis is correct, then it should be possible to write
down a collection of bigrams for English so that all phonotactically
well-formed words are allowed, and only those. Every ill-formed word
must contain at least one forbidden bigram.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Contrast the well-formed <em>kobinal</em> against the ill-formed
<em>kbin</em>. If <em>kb</em> is a forbidden bigram of English, then
<em>kbin</em> is ill-formed. In order for <em>kobinal</em> to be
well-formed, none of the following bigrams may be forbidden:
<em>⋊k</em>, <em>ko</em>, <em>ob</em>, <em>bi</em>, <em>in</em>,
<em>na</em>, <em>al</em>, <em>l⋉</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>As the example above shows, forbidding the bigram <em>kb</em> rules
out <em>kbin</em> as an illicit word for English. But there is a
problem: <em>kb</em> does occur in some well-formed words, such as
<em>cookbook</em> or <em>workbench</em>. Linguists might object that
each one of them is a compound and thus, as far as phonotactics is
concerned, might be two words rather than one. However, that does not
solve the problem of Star Wars’s Admiral Ackbar, pronounced
<em>akbar</em>. The problem with <em>kbin</em> is not <em>kb</em>, it’s
<em>kb</em> at the start of the word. The forbidden sequence is not
<em>kb</em>, but rather <em>⋊kb</em>. And the ban against starting
English words with <em>kn</em> does not mean that <em>kn</em> is a
forbidden sequence, it means that <em>⋊kn</em> is forbidden. These are
not bigrams, they are <strong>trigrams</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="n-gram-grammars">n-gram grammars</h2>
<p>We can generalize the notion of bigram to sequences of arbitrary
length. A trigram is a sequence of three elements, a 4-gram contains
four elements, and quite generally, an <strong>n-gram</strong> consists
of <strong>n</strong> elements.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let us first look at the bigrams, trigrams, and 4-grams of
<em>kobinal</em> (without edge markers). The bigrams of <em>kobinal</em>
are <em>ko</em>, <em>ob</em>, <em>bi</em>, <em>in</em>, <em>na</em>, and
<em>al</em>. The trigrams are <em>kob</em>, <em>obi</em>, <em>bin</em>,
<em>ina</em>, and <em>nal</em>. The 4-grams are <em>kobi</em>,
<em>obin</em>, <em>bina</em>, and <em>inal</em>.</p>
<p>For <em>banana</em>, the only bigrams are <em>ba</em>, <em>an</em>,
and <em>na</em>. The trigrams are <em>ban</em>, <em>ana</em>, and
<em>nan</em>. The 4-grams are <em>bana</em>, <em>anan</em>, and
<em>nana</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>One problem with large <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams
is that some words may be shorter than <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> even after edge markers have been
added. Just what are the 4-grams of <em>⋊a⋉</em>? There’s many ways this
could be fixed. We will use a method that is conceptually simple even
though it can get awkward in practice: if the grammar uses <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams, we pad out the word with <span
class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> edge markers.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider now the bigrams, trigrams, and 4-grams of <em>kobinal</em>
with edge markers ⋊ and ⋉. For bigrams, we have to look at
<em>⋊kobinal⋉</em>, which has the bigrams <em>⋊k</em>, <em>ko</em>,
<em>ob</em>, <em>bi</em>, <em>in</em>, <em>na</em>, <em>al</em>, and
<em>l⋉</em>. The trigrams are computed over <em>⋊⋊kobinal⋉⋉</em>, so
they’re <em>⋊⋊k</em>, <em>⋊ko</em>, <em>kob</em>, <em>obi</em>,
<em>bin</em>, <em>nal</em>, <em>al⋉</em>, and <em>l⋉⋉</em>. The 4-grams
are computed over <em>⋊⋊⋊kobinal⋉⋉⋉</em> and thus they are
<em>⋊⋊⋊k</em>, <em>⋊⋊ko</em>, <em>⋊kob</em>, <em>kobi</em>,
<em>obin</em>, <em>bina</em>, <em>inal</em>, <em>nal⋉</em>,
<em>al⋉⋉</em>, and <em>l⋉⋉⋉</em>.</p>
<p>For <em>banana</em>, the bigrams are now <em>⋊b</em>, <em>ba</em>,
<em>an</em>, <em>na</em>, and <em>a⋉</em>. Its trigrams are
<em>⋊⋊b</em>, <em>⋊ba</em>, <em>ban</em>, <em>ana</em>, <em>nan</em>,
<em>na⋉</em>, and <em>a⋉⋉⋉</em>. The 4-grams are <em>⋊⋊⋊b</em>,
<em>⋊⋊ba</em>, <em>⋊⋊ban</em>, <em>bana</em>, <em>anan</em>,
<em>nana</em>, <em>ana⋉</em>, <em>na⋉⋉</em>, and <em>a⋉⋉⋉</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following strings with the appropriate number of
edge markers, say whether it has been padded for use with a bigram
grammar, a trigram grammar, or a 4-gram grammar.</p>
<ul>
<li>⋊⋊kbin⋉⋉</li>
<li>⋊⋊⋊workbench⋉⋉⋉</li>
<li>⋊akbar⋉</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Now we can finally state clearly why <em>kobinal</em>,
<em>workbench</em> and <em>akbar</em> are all phonotactically
well-formed, whereas <em>kbin</em> is not: the latter contains the
illicit trigram <em>⋊kb</em>.</p>
<p>We also refine our original hypothesis about the phonotactics of
natural languages: every phonotactic system is described by a set of
forbidden <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Consider once more the word
<em>supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</em>. For each one of the
following, say whether it is a bigram of the word (with edge markers), a
trigram, a 4-gram, or none of those choices.</p>
<ul>
<li>⋊fr</li>
<li>z</li>
<li>do⋉c</li>
<li>s⋉⋉⋉</li>
<li>sit</li>
<li>cious</li>
<li>⋊sup</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Italian has intervocalic voicing, which means that it is impossible
for a voiceless consonant like <em>s</em> or <em>f</em> to occur between
two vowels. For instance, it is impossible to have a form like
<em>asola</em>, it must be <em>azola</em> with the voiced <em>z</em>
instead of a voiceless <em>s</em>. For the sake of simplicity, let us
assume that Italian only has the vowels <em>a</em> and <em>o</em>, and
the consonants <em>s</em>, <em>z</em>, and <em>l</em>. Only the
voiceless <em>s</em> is subject to intervocalic voicing. Write a
negative trigram grammar that captures intervocalic voicing in this
simplified version of Italian.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Intervocalic voicing cannot be captured with a negative bigram
grammar. That is because no negative bigram grammar can rule out the
illicit <em>asola</em> without also ruling out the well-formed
<em>alsola</em> and <em>aslola</em> (while non-existant, these words
satisfy the phonotatic laws of Italian). Explain in detail why this is
the case.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Intervocalic voicing in Italian does not always apply. The word
<em>asociale</em>, comparable to English <em>anti-social</em>, has a
voiceless <em>s</em> between <em>a</em> and <em>o</em>. However,
linguists would argue that this word is more complex because it is built
from two separate parts <em>a</em> and <em>sociale</em> that are fused
together into a single word. In technical terms, <em>a</em> and
<em>sociale</em> are two separate <em>morphemes</em>, and we should
represent <em>asociale</em> more accurately as <em>a+sociale</em> with
the morpheme boundary <em>+</em> between <em>a</em> and <em>s</em>.
Explain why, given this assumption, your negative trigram grammar for
intervocalic voicing correctly predicts <em>a+sociale</em> to be
well-formed.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="a-look-at-german">A look at German</h2>
<p>Unlike English, German is perfectly fine with words that start with
<em>kn</em>. But just like English, it does not like words that start
with <em>rb</em>. We can capture this by writing a trigram grammar for
German that contains the forbidden trigram <em>⋊rb</em>. But German also
has a process known as word-final devoicing: voiced sounds become
voiceless at the end of a word. So whereas an English speaker will
happily pronounce <em>woods</em> with a <em>z</em> at the end, a German
speaker turns the <em>z</em> into an <em>s</em> like in
<em>trinkets</em>. Alright, no big deal, we just forbid <em>z⋉</em> too.
Or do we?</p>
<p>We now have a forbidden trigram <em>⋊rb</em> and a forbidden bigram
<em>z⋉</em>. Are we allowed to mix bigrams and trigrams this way? More
generally, can every negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar also contain <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-grams, where <span
class="math inline">\(k &lt; n\)</span>? Could this create
inconsistencies, or make negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars more powerful?</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Consider the formal language where all strings are sequences of
<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> such that</p>
<ul>
<li>every string starts with <em>a</em></li>
<li>no string ends with <em>c</em></li>
<li><em>a</em> and <em>c</em> are always separated by at least two
symbols.</li>
</ul>
<p>Write a negative 4-gram grammar for this language.
<strong>Caution:</strong> This will be a big grammar. Try to write down
all the 4-grams, and once you get sick of it, you can use a template
like “xcyc where x and y are <em>a</em> or <em>b</em> or <em>c</em>”
(this specific template is just an example, it isn’t needed for the
constraints above).</p>
<p>Now that you are appropriately enraged, write an equivalent negative
grammar that mixes bigrams, trigrams and 4-grams. Which one strikes you
as a more direct description of the constraints above? Which one gave
you less grief?</p>
</div>
<h2 id="studying-formalisms-studying-language">Studying formalisms ~
studying language</h2>
<p>This isn’t just a mathematical curiosity, it is a profound question
about human cognition. If we take seriously the notion that negative
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar provide a model of
phonotactics, then whatever knowledge a native speaker of English has
about English phonotactics is in some sense similar to our negative
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram models. Of course this
involves numerous abstraction steps — we should not expect MRIs and
other tools of neuroscience to find anything like the <em>negative
n-gram center</em> of the brain where words get broken down into their
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams and each <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram is checked for correctness. But we
are making a cognitive commitment that phonotactics involves reasoning
steps comparable to those of a negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar and not something
completely different, like keeping track of the number of consonants and
penalizing words with an even number of consonants. That kind of
“even-consonant filter” would be something completely unlike what the
negative <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar are doing,
and it would be a fundamental change to what we think is going on in a
speaker’s mind when they determine that, say, <em>kbinl</em> is not a
possible word of English.</p>
<p>But what about more innocuous changes like allowing <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams of various lengths? Is that just
a matter of notational convenience, or does it fundamentally change the
model and hence the cognitive commitments that come from adopting this
model? Or what if we used <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams
to encode allowed sequences rather than forbidden ones? Intuitively this
feels like a very different kind of grammar, but is it really?</p>
<p>Linguistics is actually full of discussions of this type. Somebody
proposes model M and then somebody else argues that M fails to account
for phenomenon P in language L and needs some extension X. But then
somebody else argues that X is not needed after all because P has been
misanalyzed and the more accurate description of P is perfectly
compatible with the original model M. This kind of argumentation has
proven very productive for linguistics, but it is very labor intensive
and the results are not very transferable. One minor change to model M
could completely change whether we need extension X after all to handle
phenomenon P, and it can be difficult to tell what changes to M are such
that X becomes indispensable for P. Linguistic results tend to be very
specific and detailed, but among the many pieces of data and the
intricate reasoning steps it can be hard to determine what is truly
essential for the argument.</p>
<p>Mathematics allows us to study formalisms at a more general level,
and this in turn enables us to make discoveries that would be
unattainable with linguistic methods. For example, we will be able to
show that allowing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams of
varying length does not fundamentally change our negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram model, and this will be true no
matter how long the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams are. We
can make claims that are provably correct for every negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar. And we can do that even
though there are infinitely many such grammars (because there are
infinitely many values <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> may take)
and it is impossible to ever look at each one of them. Our mathematical
proof will also tell us exactly why this fact holds and under what
circumstances it would no longer go through. And by extension, the
mathematics tells us that there is a whole class of models that are
equivalent to ours in terms of what they claim about the nature of an
English speaker’s cognitive ability to distinguish the well-formed
<em>blink</em> from the ill-formed <em>kbinl</em>. Buckle up everyone,
we have some mathematical analysis to do!</p>
