<h1 id="the-mathematics-of-tiers-work-in-progress">The mathematics of
tiers (work in progress)</h1>
<p>Tiers are a nice linguistic metaphor, but what is going on here at a
formal level? Exactly the same thing as with stop word removal. We have
a function that removes all irrelevant elements, and then we apply a
specific procedure to the output of this function. For stop word
removal, that follow-up procedure was the construction of a bag of
words. With tier projection, we instead test the output for
well-formedness with respect to an <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar.</p>
<h2 id="the-mathematics-of-tiers">The mathematics of tiers</h2>
<p>Remember that <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{del}_S\)</span> is
a function that takes a string as its input and deletes all symbols that
belong <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Tier projection works
pretty much the same, except that one usually specifies which symbols to
keep rather than which to delete. So given a set <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> of tier symbols, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{del}_T\)</span> takes a string as its
input and keeps only those symbols that belong to <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. This difference is very similar to the
split between positive and negative grammars: <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> specifies what may be kept, <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> what must not be kept. We can unify
stop word removal and tier projection to a single function <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{del}_X\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is some set with a specified polarity.
With <span class="math inline">\(\mathit{del}_{^+X}\)</span>, only the
symbols in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> are kept, whereas
<span class="math inline">\(\mathit{del}_{^-X}\)</span> removes all
symbols that belong to <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> (and only
those).</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Compute the values for all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathit{del}_{^-\left \{ a,b \right
\}}(\mathit{aaccbad})\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathit{del}_{^+\left \{ a,b \right
\}}(\mathit{aaccbad})\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathit{del}_{^+\left \{ a,b \right
\}}(\mathit{aababad})\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathit{del}_{^-\left \{ a,b \right
\}}(\mathit{aababad})\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathit{del}_{^-\left \{ a,b \right
\}}(\varepsilon)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mathit{del}_{^+\left \{ a,b \right
\}}(\varepsilon)\)</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You might think that this isn’t a true unification, we have just
moved the difference between stop word removal and tier projection into
the polarity distinction. But just as with <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars, polarity doesn’t
actually matter. For every set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of
symbols drawn from some fixed alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, there is some set <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{del}_{^-A}(s) =
\mathit{del}_{^+B}(s)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{del}_{^+A}(s) =
\mathit{del}_{^-B}\)</span> for every string <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> over <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Explain why this holds. Illustrate your argument with a few
examples.</p>
</div>
<p>This is a pretty nifty result. Intuitively, stop word removal and
tier projection seem completely unrelated. One is about cleaning up data
for practical applications, the other about simplifying linguistic
analysis. But mathematically, they are exactly the same thing. In later
units, we will see many more examples of this unifying power of
math.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>The term <strong>culminativity</strong> refers to the property that
every word has exactly one primary stress. Suppose that our alphabet is
<span class="math inline">\(\left \{ \sigma, \acute{\sigma} \right
\}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> denotes
an unstressed syllable and <span
class="math inline">\(\acute{\sigma}\)</span> one with primary stress.
Specify a set <span class="math inline">\(^+T\)</span> of tier symbols
and a bigram grammar <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> to capture
culminativity (<em>hint</em>: &gt; and &lt; can be used with tiers,
too).</p>
</div>
<p>key properties preserved because it’s still just <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars, but over a tier instead
of the string itself</p>
<ul>
<li>The stop word removal function <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{del}\)</span> is also the function for
constructing phonological tiers.</li>
<li>Math allows us to unify things that look very different at the
surface. In particular, linguistic theory and language technology seem
like very different beasts, but they actually share a lot of math.</li>
