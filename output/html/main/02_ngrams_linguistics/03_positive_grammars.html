<div class="prereqs">
<ul>

</ul>
</div>
<p>We now have a simple model of phonotactics, i.e. what sequences of
sounds may occur in the words of a natural language. According to this
model, the phonotactic well-formedness of a word can be determined from
the chunks that said word is built from. In a trigram model, for
instance, a word is ill-formed iff it contains one or more illicit
trigrams. We formalize this in terms of a negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar, which is a finite set of
illicit <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose our alphabet, i.e. the set of available symbols, is <span
class="math inline">\(\left \{ a,b,c \right \}\)</span>. Then the
negative trigram grammar <span class="math inline">\(\left \{
\mathit{aac}, \mathit{abc}, \mathit{acc} \right \}\)</span> only permits
strings where no symbol is directly sandwiched between <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The model looks rather promising as it can handle a variety of
phenomena that have been studied extensively by linguists: word-final
devoicing, intervocalic voicing, local assimilation, and various stress
rules.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following phenomena, write a negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar that handles it correctly.
For some of them, you have to rephrase the phenomenon as a phonotactic
constraint first.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>intervocalic voicing</strong>: voiceless fricatives (assume
<em>s</em> and <em>f</em>) may not occur between vowels (assume
<em>a</em>, <em>i</em>, <em>u</em>)</li>
<li><strong>local assimilation</strong>: <em>n</em> must be <em>m</em>
before <em>b</em> or <em>p</em></li>
<li><strong>local dissimilation</strong>: <em>rVr</em> becomes
<em>lVr</em>, where <em>V</em> is <em>a</em>, <em>i</em>, or
<em>u</em></li>
<li><strong>penultimate stress</strong>: in words with at least two
syllables, stress falls on the last but one syllable (assume that words
are strings of stressed syllables (<span
class="math inline">\(\acute{\sigma}\)</span>) and unstressed syllables
(<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>))</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Since the model seems to work well for phonotactics, it is tempting
to expand it to other domains of language. But as we will see next, this
reveals certain shortcomings of the negative grammar format.</p>
<h2 id="morphotactics">Morphotactics</h2>
<p>Just like phonotactics regulates the linear order of sounds in a
word, <strong>morphotactics</strong> regulates the linear order of
<strong>morphemes</strong>. Morphemes consist of multiple sounds and are
the building blocks of words (linguists, please keep in mind that once
again we won’t distinguish between morphemes, morphs, and allomorphs).
For example, <em>denaturalization</em> is built from the morphemes
<em>de-</em>, <em>nature</em>, <em>-al</em>, <em>-ize</em>, and
<em>-ation</em>. Morphemes cannot be combined willy-nilly, they have to
follow a specific order. In the case of <em>denaturalization</em>, no
other order is possible. Even though the word is built up from 5
elements, which could be arranged in <span class="math inline">\(5! = 5
\times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\)</span> distinct ways, only
one of them is actually allowed by English. So morphotactics defines a
very tight rule system for how elements may be ordered in a word, much
tighter than phonotactics, where individual sounds have more leeway as
to where they occur in a word.</p>
<p>Let’s see if we can write a negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar that allows for
<em>denaturalization</em> but forbids all illicit orders,
e.g. <em>naturedeationizal</em>. First, we have to pick the basic
building blocks for the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams.
For phonotactics, we used <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams
where each symbol is a sound, but this is too fine-grained for
morphotactics. Instead, we will use <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams where each symbol is a morpheme.
If we used sounds, then <em>-ize -ation</em> would be an 11-gram that
consists of 8 letters, 2 hyphens, and 1 space. But since we use
morphemes as our basic building blocks, <em>-ize -ation</em> is a
bigram.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams, say how large it is depending on
what one chooses as the basic symbols that <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams are built from. Possible choices
for building blocks are typed characters, morphemes, or words. Not all
choice may be appropriate in each case.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>de-</em></li>
<li><em>mpi</em></li>
<li><em>John likes Mary</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>With each morpheme as a separate symbol, it should be
straight-forward to design a negative grammar to generate
<em>de-nature-al-ize-ation</em> but none of the other orders. Let’s
first write down the conditions in plain English:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>start with <em>de-</em>,</li>
<li><em>de-</em> is followed by <em>nature</em>,</li>
<li><em>nature</em> is followed by <em>-al</em>,</li>
<li><em>-al</em> is followed by <em>-ize</em>,</li>
<li><em>-ize</em> is followed by <em>-ation</em>,</li>
<li>end with <em>-ation</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Easy peasy, so let’s write it down as a negative grammar. Here’s the
list of the forbidden <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams that
correspond to each one of the conditions.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>start with <em>de-</em>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>⋊ $</em></li>
<li><em>⋊ nature</em></li>
<li><em>⋊ -al</em></li>
<li><em>⋊ -ize</em></li>
<li><em>⋊ -ation</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>de-</em> is followed by <em>nature</em>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>de- $</em></li>
<li><em>de- de-</em></li>
<li><em>de- -al</em></li>
<li><em>de- ize</em></li>
<li><em>de -ation</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>nature</em> is followed by <em>-al</em>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>nature ⋉</em></li>
<li><em>nature de-</em></li>
<li><em>nature nature</em></li>
<li><em>nature -ize</em></li>
<li><em>nature -ation</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>-al</em> is followed by <em>-ize</em>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>-al ⋉</em></li>
<li><em>-al de-</em></li>
<li><em>-al nature</em></li>
<li><em>-al -al</em></li>
<li><em>-al -ation</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>-ize</em> is followed by <em>-ation</em>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>-ize ⋉</em></li>
<li><em>-ize de-</em></li>
<li><em>-ize nature</em></li>
<li><em>-ize -al</em></li>

<li><em>-ation nature</em></li>
<li><em>-ation -al</em></li>
<li><em>-ation ize</em></li>
<li><em>-ation -ation</em></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Hmm, that didn’t turn out as succinctly as one might have hoped.</p>
<h2 id="from-negative-to-positive-grammars">From negative to positive
grammars…</h2>
<p>The negative bigram grammar above is much larger than one would
expect. Perhaps even more problematically, it does not clearly express
the relevant generalizations. Intuitively, it would be much more
appealing to list what combinations are allowed, rather than
forbidden:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>start with <em>de-</em>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>⋊ de-</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>de-</em> is followed by <em>nature</em>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>de- nature</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>nature</em> is followed by <em>-al</em>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>nature -al</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>-al</em> is followed by <em>-ize</em>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>-al -ize</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li><em>-ize</em> is followed by <em>-ation</em>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>-ize -ation</em></li>
</ol></li>
<li>end with <em>-ation</em>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>-ation ⋉</em></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>This is a <strong>positive <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar</strong>, where the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams list what sequences are allowed,
rather than forbidden.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The list of bigrams above is <em>⋊ de-</em>, <em>de- nature</em>,
<em>nature -al</em>, <em>-al -ize</em>, <em>-ize -ation</em>, <em>-ation
⋉</em>. If this is interpreted as positive bigram grammar, then only
<em>denaturalization</em> is well-formed. A string like <em>nature -al
-ize -ation -de</em> is illicit because it contains the bigram
<em>-ation de-</em>, which is not part of the positive grammar and thus
forbidden. If one adds <em>nature ⋉</em> to the grammar, then
<em>nature</em> can also be generated.</p>
</div>
<p>In positive <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars, all
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams must be of the same length
to avoid inconsistencies. That’s because with a positive <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar, a word is well-formed iff
each one of its <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams is part of
the grammar.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose we want to allow both <em>natural</em> and
<em>denaturalization</em>, but not <em>denatural</em>. In order to allow
the former, the grammar has to contain the bigrams <em>⋊ nature</em>,
<em>nature -al</em>, and <em>-al ⋉</em>. But in combination with the
bigrams from the previous example, this would also allow for
<em>denatural</em>. Instead, then, one might try replacing <em>⋊
de-</em> with the 5-gram <em>⋊ de- nature -al -ize</em>, so that the
grammar looks as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>⋊ de- nature -al -ize</em></li>
<li><em>de- nature</em></li>
<li><em>nature -al</em></li>
<li><em>-al -ize</em></li>
<li><em>-ize -ation</em></li>
</ul>
<p>But then it is unclear how the grammar should be evaluated. If we
look at all the 5-grams of <em>⋊ de- nature -al -ize -ation</em>, then
only <em>⋊ de -nature -al -ize</em> is part of the grammar and the
string is incorrectly ruled out. If we instead look at all the bigrams,
then the word is ruled out because <em>⋊ de-</em> is no longer part of
the grammar. Either way the mixing of bigrams and 5-grams causes
inconsistencies.</p>
</div>
<p>Despite the requirement to stick with one fixed length of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams, positive grammars can be much
smaller than negative ones. But the opposite is also true, in particular
for mixed negative grammars. It depends on the specific phenomenon.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Many languages only allow syllables of the form <em>CV</em>, where C
is some consonant and V is a vowel. In these languages, words are of the
from <em>CV</em>, <em>CVCV</em>, <em>CVCVCV</em>, and so on. Write both
a positive and a negative grammar that only allows strings of this form.
Is one grammar significantly smaller than the other?</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Continuing the previous exercise, suppose that we use actual
consonants and vowels instead of the abstract symbols C and V. Assume
that the language has 5 consonants (<em>p</em>, <em>t</em>, <em>k</em>,
<em>s</em>, <em>f</em>) and only one vowel (<em>a</em>). So this
language allows strings like <em>papa</em> or <em>tasa</em>, but not
<em>tas</em>, <em>psafa</em>, or <em>saaka</em>. Write both a positive
and a negative grammar that only allows strings of this form. Is one
grammar significantly smaller than the other?</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following phenomena, write a positive <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar that handles it correctly.
For some of them, you have to rephrase the phenomenon as a phonotactic
constraint first. You will also have to make assumptions about the sound
inventory of the language.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>intervocalic voicing</strong>: voiceless fricatives (assume
<em>s</em> and <em>f</em>) may not occur between vowels (assume
<em>a</em>, <em>i</em>, <em>u</em>)</li>
<li><strong>local assimilation</strong>: <em>n</em> must be <em>m</em>
before <em>b</em> or <em>p</em></li>
<li><strong>local disimilation</strong>: <em>rVr</em> becomes
<em>lVr</em>, where <em>V</em> is <em>a</em>, <em>i</em>, or
<em>u</em></li>
<li><strong>penultimate stress</strong>: in words with at least two
syllables, stress falls on the last but one syllable (assume that words
are strings of stress syllables (<span
class="math inline">\(\acute{\sigma}\)</span>) and unstressed syllables
(<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>))</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’re done, contrast the positive grammars against the negative
ones from an earlier exercise. Can you identify some general guidelines
for when a positive grammar is preferable to a negative one?</p>
</div>
<h2
id="and-back-translating-between-positive-and-negative-grammars">…and
back: Translating between positive and negative grammars</h2>
<p>We now have two different kinds of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars: positive grammars, and
negative grammars. The latter actually span two subtypes, strict
negative grammars and mixed negative grammars, but as we have already
proved those two are equivalent in the sense that one can freely
translate between them. The same is in fact true for positive and
negative grammars.</p>
<p>The idea is very simple. Suppose that your alphabet (i.e. the set of
symbols from which strings are built) contains only <em>a</em> and
<em>b</em>. Then consider the language <span
class="math inline">\((\mathit{aba})^+\)</span>, which contains
<em>aba</em>, <em>ababa</em>, <em>abababa</em>, and so on. The negative
grammar generating this language consists of</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>⋊⋉</em> (no string without any symbols),</li>
<li><em>⋊b</em> (don’t start with <em>b</em>),</li>
<li><em>aa</em> (don’t have <em>a</em> followed by <em>a</em>),</li>
<li><em>bb</em> (don’t have <em>b</em> followed by <em>b</em>),</li>
<li><em>b⋉</em> (don’t end with <em>b</em>).</li>
</ol>
<p>The positive grammar, on the other hand, contains</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>⋊a</em> (you may start with <em>a</em>),</li>
<li><em>ab</em> (<em>a</em> may be followed by <em>b</em>),</li>
<li><em>ba</em> (<em>b</em> may be followed by <em>a</em>),</li>
<li><em>a⋉</em> (you may end with <em>a</em>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Now compare this to the list of all possible bigrams over <em>a</em>,
<em>b</em>, and the edge markers ⋊ and ⋉ (we ignore useless bigrams such
as ⋉⋊, which can never occur in a string):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>⋊⋉</em>,</li>
<li><em>⋊a</em>,</li>
<li><em>⋊b</em>,</li>
<li><em>a⋉</em>,</li>
<li><em>aa</em>,</li>
<li><em>ab</em>,</li>
<li><em>b⋉</em>,</li>
<li><em>ba</em>,</li>
<li><em>bb</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice anything? Each one of those bigrams is either in the negative
grammar or in the positive one, but never in both. So in order to
convert a positive grammar to a negative one, or the other way round, it
suffices to first compute all possible <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams and then remove all those that
are in the grammar that is to be converted to the opposite polarity.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose our alphabet contains only <em>a</em> and that the only
well-formed string is <em>aa</em>. This would be the case if we have a
positive trigram grammar containing:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>⋊⋊a</em></li>
<li><em>⋊aa</em></li>
<li><em>aa⋉</em></li>
<li><em>a⋉⋉</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The set of all possible (and useful) trigrams over the alphabet is as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>⋊⋊a</em></li>
<li><em>⋊⋊⋉</em></li>
<li><em>⋊aa</em></li>
<li><em>⋊a⋉</em></li>
<li><em>⋊⋉⋉</em></li>
<li><em>aaa</em></li>
<li><em>aa⋉</em></li>
<li><em>a⋉⋉</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Removing all trigrams of the positive trigram grammar leaves us with
the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>⋊⋊⋉</em></li>
<li><em>⋊⋉⋉</em></li>
<li><em>⋊a⋉</em></li>
<li><em>aaa</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You can verify for yourself that a negative trigram grammar that
contains those four trigrams (and no other <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams) can only generate <em>aa</em>
over the alphabet <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ a \right
\}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>English allows for <em>nature</em>, <em>natural</em>,
<em>naturalize</em>, <em>denature</em>, <em>denaturalize</em>,
<em>naturalization</em>, and <em>denaturalization</em>, but not
<em>denatural</em> or any of misordered forms like
<em>naturizalation</em>. Write a grammar that generates all the
well-formed forms but none of the ill-formed ones. It is up to you
whether you want to use a positive or a negative grammar. If you use a
negative grammar, it can be in the mixed format, with <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams of varying lengths.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="an-important-take-home-message">An important take-home
message</h2>
<p>The next section will give a formal proof that the simple conversion
strategy laid out above will always result in an equivalent grammar. By
“equivalent” we mean that the two grammars generate exactly the same
strings — there is no string such that the two grammars disagree on
whether the string is well-formed or ill-formed. This might seem like a
mathematical curiosity to you, but it actually challenges one of the
most fundamental assumptions of theoretical linguistics.</p>
<p>Linguists like to talk about <strong>the</strong> grammar,
<strong>the</strong> right description, <strong>the</strong> correct
generalization. <strong>the</strong> feature system,
<strong>the</strong> constraints of the grammar, as if those were
concrete objects of a singular nature — like a chair is a chair is a
chair. Linguistics is driven by the search for <strong>the</strong>
correct description of linguistic knowledge. Linguists want the “source
code” of the language program that runs in the human brain, not just any
implementation that exhibits the same behavior. To a linguist, true
understanding of language is achieved when we have found the one and
only true model. If it looks like we have multiple equally viable
analyses, descriptions, theories, or formalisms, then that just shows
that we don’t know enough about language yet to tease them apart. Our
mathematical findings show us that things aren’t that simple, this quest
for <em>the</em> one unique correct specification does not work for
abstract concepts. And all linguistic concepts are abstract. When
dealing with abstract ideas, you want to be able to conceptualize them
in as many distinct ways as possible. True understanding comes from the
ability to describe one and the same thing in many different ways, each
one with its unique advantages and its unique opportunities for new
insights.</p>
<p>Now admittedly there is more linguistic data than just what strings
are well-formed or ill-formed. For example, we can put native speakers
into fMRI machines to get an inkling of an idea of what computations
occur in a native speaker’s brain when they are asked to determine
whether a word is well-formed. But the data one obtains this way is very
different in nature from the models linguists operate with. The brain
data has to be given a specific interpretation in order to link it to
linguistic models, and there are many different plausible
implementations to choose from. Just like there may not be such a thing
as <strong>the</strong> correct grammar, there may not be such a thing
as <strong>the</strong> correct linking hypothesis. We may well be
living in a world where grammar <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>
plus linking hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> makes
exactly the same predictions as grammar <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> with linking hypothesis <span
class="math inline">\(L&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p>Rather than reject this scenario or trying to argue it away, we
should embrace it. The conventional wisdom that true understanding of
language means having converged on exactly one way of looking at
language has it exactly the wrong way around. True understanding of
language means having many different ways of looking at language that we
can effortlessly switch between depending on which view is most useful
for the problem at hand. In some cases, a positive grammar may be
smaller than a negative one. For some phenomena it is the other way
round. A negative grammar also has the advantage that they can be made
more compact by using a mixed format instead of a fixed length for all
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams. Then again, positive
grammars are easier to translate to <strong>finite-state
automata</strong>, which we will encounter in a later chapter. Each
grammar format has its pros and cons, and there is no reason why we
should insist that, say, mixed negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars are the one right
answer.</p>
<p>Interdefinability results of this kind are one of the driving forces
of mathematics. Logical formulas, for example, can be put into a normal
form that is harder to read for humans but easier to implement for
computers. Finite-state automata can be viewed as a special case of
Boolean matrix multiplication (we’ll talk about this one in quite some
detail). Interdefinability isn’t a horror scenario to avoid, it is one
of the most powerful results possible, but in order to get to these
results, we need mathematics.</p>
