<h1 id="analyzing-negative-n-gram-grammars">Analyzing negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars</h1>
<p>In the previous unit, we entertained the idea that natural language
phonotactics can be described in terms of a collection of forbidden
sound sequences. Such a collection is called a forbidden <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar, and each <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram represents one forbidden sound
sequence of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. But this idea
ran into a problem. In German, words cannot start with <em>rb</em>,
which is captured by adding the trigram <em>⋊rb</em> to the list of
illicit <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams (remember that ⋊ is
a special symbol that indicates the left edge of a word). But German
also has word-final devoicing, which means that no word can end in a
voiced <em>s</em>-sound, which corresponds to <em>z</em> in English
orthography. Using this notational convention, we can represent the
illicit sequence as <em>z⋉</em> (with ⋉ as the right edge counterpart of
⋊). This is a bigram, whereas <em>⋊rb</em> is a trigram. What are the
consequences of mixing bigrams and trigrams in a single <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar? Does this introduce
inconsistencies such that a word is both forbidden and allowed? Let’s
try to answer this question. Fair warning: this will be a bit of a pain,
and that’s actually the point of this unit.</p>
<h2 id="a-plea-for-proofs">A plea for proofs</h2>
<p>Unless you’re a mathematician, your first instinct will be to work
through one or more examples. If we, say, construct 100 grammars that
include bigrams and trigrams and don’t run into any problems, it’s
probably fine to mix and match. But this has several downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>So much work…</strong><br />
Constructing and testing 100 grammars doesn’t exactly sound like fun.
Sure, you could write a program to do it for you, but that’s also work.
And your program might have bugs, which takes us to the next
point.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No guarantees</strong><br />
Just because your simulations produce a certain result does not mean
that things always work this way. If you ask 1000 people if they’ve ever
read Werner Schwab’s <em>Fäkaliendramen</em> (feces dramas), the answers
will probably all be No. But if your sample happened to include lots of
Austrian literature buffs, you’ll hear Yes a lot more often. Similarly,
the grammars you construct for your simulation might exhibit a special
property that allows them to pass the test. There might still be
grammars that do not display this property and fail. If you construct
the grammars with a program, your code might be written in a way that
only produces grammars of a specific type. Bottom line: if you are
testing based on examples, you can never be sure that your examples
cover all possible cases that need testing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No scalability</strong><br />
Alright, suppose you actually wrote a program that is free of any bias
and ran a huge number of simulations for grammar with mixed bigrams and
trigrams. You now feel very confident that mixing of bigrams and
trigrams is unproblematic. What about 4-grams? 5-grams? 127-grams? How
do you know that your results will carry over from bigrams and trigrams
to arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Computer-aided simulations are a very common tool nowadays, but that
does not mean that they are perfect. They are hard to design, often
require significant resources, and do not provide complete insight into
how the specific aspects of a system determine its behavior. That’s not
to say that simulations are a bad thing — if you are dealing with a very
complex system, they’re often the best tool at your disposal. But there
are other tools around, and in many cases they are a superior choice.
Mathematics furnishes the most powerful tool of them all: proofs!</p>
<p>A mathematical proof starts out from a fixed set of assumptions and
shows how these assumptions entail a specific property. We will see a
concrete example in a moment, but let’s first focus on the specific
advantages of proofs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Laziness</strong><br />
Hard proofs are very, very hard. They are much harder than designing a
simulation. But unless you are a professional mathematician, most proofs
you’ll ever see are fairly easy. And easy proofs require very little
effort. You can often work them out in less than 30 minutes, and they
only take a few lines to write down.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Guarantees</strong><br />
Of course a proof may contain mistakes, just like a program may contain
bugs. But since your average proof is much smaller than your average
program, mistakes in a proof tend to be easier to spot than bugs in a
program. Fixing a mistake in a proof also tends to be much simpler than
determining whether a simulation has hidden biases and correcting for
that. And most importantly, once you have a correct proof, you have a
guarantee: as long as the assumptions of the proof hold, the property
established by proof holds, too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability</strong><br />
Since a proof holds as long as its initial assumptions are satisfied, it
can be extended to any object that satisfies these assumptions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This may all sound awfully abstract to you. So let’s finally turn to
our first proof, because the proof of the pudding is in the eating
(sorry, I couldn’t resist). We will show that a negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar that also contains, say,
bigrams and trigrams can be converted to an equivalent <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar that only contains <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams. While reading through the proof,
keep in mind the three properties above (laziness, guarantees,
scalability), and think about how they’re instantiated in the proof.</p>
<h2 id="our-first-proof-mixed-n-gram-grammars">Our first proof: Mixed
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars</h2>
<h3 id="formalizing-the-problem">Formalizing the problem</h3>
<p>Our initial question is whether there is any problem with mixing
bigrams and trigrams in a single grammar. This is not a very precise
question. What exactly constitutes a problem? If you have to write on a
tiny piece of paper that can barely hold a single bigram, adding a
trigram to the mix creates problems. Such pesky tribulations of daily
life are obviously not our concern here. Remember that we use negative
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars as a model of
natural language phonotactics. So their job is to describe which
potential words are well-formed and which are ill-formed. We would have
a problem if this failed for some reason: a word is both well-formed or
ill-formed, a word that is ill-formed suddenly becomes well-formed when
bigrams and trigrams are mixed, or the other way round.</p>
<p>We will show that none of these issues ever arise; we do so by
establishing a <strong>normal form theorem</strong>. Whenever a grammar
contains <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams of different
sizes, it can be converted to a grammar where all <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams are of the same size. This
converted grammar is equivalent to the original in the sense that they
make the same phonotactic judgments: the first grammar deems a word
well-formed iff the second one does, too, and the two also agree on
which words are ill-formed. The second grammar thus behaves exactly like
the first, but has a normalized form without any <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams of different length. That’s why
the second grammar is called a <strong>normal form</strong> of the first
one. <strong>Theorem</strong> is just a fancy term for a statement that
follows from a fixed set of assumptions. So we are proving a theorem
about the existence of a normal form, hence the term <strong>normal form
theorem</strong>.</p>
<p>In order to avoid an overload of notation and terminology, we state
the theorem in a slightly inaccurate manner as follows:</p>
<div class="theorem">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be some negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar such that <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the length of the longest <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram. Then there exists an equivalent
negative grammar <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> such that
every <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram of <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> has length <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="proof">Proof</h3>
<p>We start with a few key observations.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every language has only finitely many sounds. The precise number
does not matter here, it could be 2, it could be 2 trillion trillion.
The important thing is that it is finite. We use <span
class="math inline">\(\left | \Sigma \right |\)</span> as the special
symbol for this number.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>If a language only has the sounds <em>a</em>, <em>u</em>, <em>i</em>,
<em>b</em>, <em>m</em>, <em>d</em>, <em>g</em>, and <em>h</em>, then
<span class="math inline">\(\left | \Sigma \right |\)</span> for that
specific language is <span class="math inline">\(8\)</span>.</p>
</div></li>
<li><p>As stated in the theorem, the longest <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram is assumed to have length <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Since each position is filled by
either a sound or one of two edge markers (⋊ or ⋉), there are <span
class="math inline">\(\left | \Sigma \right | + 2\)</span> choices for
each one of those <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> positions.
Consequently, there are at most <span
class="math inline">\(\overbrace{(\left | \Sigma \right |+2) \times
\cdots \times (\left | \Sigma+2) \right |)}^{k\ \mathrm{times}} = (\left
| \Sigma \right |+2)^k\)</span> different <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams of length <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. This implies that for every possible
value of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, there are only finitely
many <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams of length <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Note that this also implies that <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> contains only finitely many <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose that the language only has the sounds <em>a</em> and
<em>d</em>, barely enough for <em>dada</em>. It’s value for <span
class="math inline">\(\left | \Sigma \right |\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. Let us calculate how many trigrams
there are. Since we are dealing with trigrams, <span
class="math inline">\(k=3\)</span>. Given the formula above, this means
there are <span class="math inline">\((\left | \Sigma \right |+2)^k =
(2+2)^3 = 4^3 = 64\)</span> different trigrams. Not all of them are ever
useful. In particular, no word ever contains an edge marker in the
middle, so <em>a⋊a</em> and <em>a⋉a</em> serve no purpose. It is also
impossible for ⋉ to occur to the left of ⋊, which rules out trigrams
like <em>⋉a⋊</em> and <em>⋉⋊a</em>. Filtering out those useless trigrams
leaves us with the following:</p>

</table>
<p>But even if we had included all useless trigrams, that would not
change the fact that there are only finitely many trigrams over
<em>a</em>, <em>d</em>, and the edge markers.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>Now suppose that we pick one of the finitely many <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams of our grammar <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Call this <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>. If the length of <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is already <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, we do not need to do anything to make
it an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram of length <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. But if its length <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is strictly less than <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, we need to replace <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> by something equivalent of length <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. More precisely, we replace <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> with every possible <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram of length <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> that contains <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> as a <em>substring</em>. By this we
mean that <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> occurs inside of these
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider once more our toy language that only has the sounds
<em>a</em> and <em>d</em>. We have already constructed the set of all
possible (and useful) trigrams for this language in the previous
example. Now suppose that we have a negative grammar <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> that contains two <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams, one being the trigram
<em>ada</em> and the other the bigram <em>dd</em>. Let us indicate this
by making them boldface in our table.</p>
<p>We want to convert <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> into an
equivalent grammar <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> that only
uses trigrams. Since <em>ada</em> is already a trigram, we keep it as
is. But <em>dd</em> is a bigram and thus has to be replaced with every
trigram that contains the substring <em>dd</em>. Consulting the list
from the previous example, we see that these are</p>
<ul>
<li>add, dda, ddd, dd⋉, ⋊dd</li>
</ul>
<p>After the replacement step, we are left with a negative grammar <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> that contains six forbidden <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams, all of which are trigrams:</p>
<ul>
<li>ada, add, dda, ddd, dd⋉, ⋊dd</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The new grammar <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span>
constructed this way is equivalent to <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. By “equivalent” we mean that the
following holds for every string: <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> both deem the string
well-formed, or <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> both deem the string ill-formed.
There is no string that is well-formed for <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> but ill-formed for <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span>, or the other way around.</p>
<p>To see this, suppose that some string is ill-formed according to
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Then some <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> must occur in the string, otherwise the
string would not be deemed ill-formed by <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Case 1</strong><br />
If <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> has length <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, then it is also an <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram of <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> would consider the string illicit,
too.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Remember that our example grammar <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> disallows <em>ada</em> and <em>dd</em>.
Since <em>ada</em> already has maximal length in <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, we carried it over to <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> without changes. So if some word
is forbidden by <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> because it
contains <em>ada</em>, it will also be forbidden by <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span>, which does not allow <em>ada</em>
either.</p>
</div></li>
<li><p><strong>Case 2</strong><br />
Now assume that <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>’s length is less
than <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> contains at least one <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram of length <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> that has <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> as a substring and that occurs in the
illicit string.</p>
<p>Here is why:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remember that a string for an <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar is padded with <span
class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> edge markers. So with respect to
<span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span>, whose longest <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram has length <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, every string has <span
class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> edge markers to its left and <span
class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> edge markers to its right. This means
every string has at least length <span class="math inline">\(2 \times(k
- 1) = 2k - 2\)</span>, which is at least as big as <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider once more the illicit string, whatever it may be.
Somewhere inside the string is an offending instance of the illicit
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>. There must be symbols to its left and
right, at the very least some edge markers. We know this because <span
class="math inline">\(n &lt; k \leq 2k - 2\)</span>. But <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> contains every <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram of length <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> that contains <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> as a substring. So if a string contains
<span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, it also contains at least one of
these illicit <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<p>Continuing the previous example, consider the word <em>dadd</em>. It
is considered illicit by <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> because
it contains <em>dd</em>. This string is also considered illicit by <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span>. With edge markers, the word is
<em>⋊⋊dadd⋉⋉</em>. During the construction process for <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span>, we replaced <em>dd</em> with
several trigrams, two of which occur in this word:</p>
<ul>
<li>add</li>
<li>dd⋉</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> agrees with
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> that <em>dadd</em> is
ill-formed.</p>
</div></li>
</ul>
<p>The discussion above shows that every string that is deemed illicit
by <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is also illicit with respect
to <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span>. We still have to show
the opposite, i.e. that every string deemed illicit by <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> is also illicit with respect to
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Fortunately, this is much
easier. Suppose that a string is ruled out by <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> because it contains the <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Case 1</strong><br />
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> contains <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, too. Then <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> also deems the string illicit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Case 2</strong><br />
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> does not contain <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> must contain some substring <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>. But every string that contains <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span> also contains every substring of <span
class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, including <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. Consequently, <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> deems the string illicit, too.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> agree on which strings are
illicit, they necessarily agree on which strings are well-formed. So by
carrying out the procedure above for every <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, one obtains a grammar <span
class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> that is equivalent to <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> but only contains <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams of a fixed length.</p>
<h2 id="some-thoughts">Some thoughts</h2>
<p>You might cry foul at this point. I promised you that proofs are easy
and quickly written down with a few lines, and the one above is neither.
It’s very long, and it’s cumbersome to read, and the sentences are hard
to make sense of. But that’s because everything was explained in plain
English rather than mathematical notation. This made the proof harder to
read and much longer, and it also means that we had to rely on examples
to explain what exactly is intended at each step of the proof. The next
unit will present the same proof in mathematical notation, and while it
may be initially harder for you, this format will be a lot easier for
you once you have some experience.</p>
<p>In fact, this is why it is so helpful to learn math. Many things are
intuitive enough that they can be explained in plain English. But it is
clumsy, imprecise, and takes longer. Specialized notation and
terminology makes things easier to talk and think about, not harder.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<ul>
<li>In a <strong>fixed</strong> negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar, all <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams must have the same length. In a
<strong>mixed</strong> negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar, this requirement is
lifted and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams may be of
different lengths.</li>
<li>Every mixed negative <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram
grammar can be converted into an equivalent fixed negative <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar. This is an instance of a
<strong>normal form theorem</strong>.</li>
<li>We can use mathematical proofs to establish results that are
guaranteed to hold whenever the conditions assumed by the proof are met.
In contrast to simulations, proofs allow us to leave some parameters
unspecified, e.g. the length of the n-grams. In addition, we do not need
to worry about accidental gaps or biases in our simulations because a
proof states explicitly which assumptions it is built on.</li>

<!--  -->
<!--   We have to pad out *z{{{R}}}* from a bigram to a 4-gram. -->
<!--   The length difference between a bigram and a 4-gram is 2, so we have to put bigrams in front of *z{{{R}}}*. -->

<!--   nz, -->

<!--   So we remove *z{{{R}}}* from $G$ and instead add all of the following. -->

<!-- - Finally, pick any two $n$-grams of length $i'$ and $i''$ such that $i' + i + i'' = k$ (remember that $i$ is the length of the n-gram $g$ that must padded out, and $k$ is the length of the longest $n$-gram in the grammar). -->
<!--   Sandwich $g$ between those $n$-grams and add the result to the grammar $G$. -->
<!--  -->
<!--   ::: example -->
<!--   Since the difference between a 4-gram and a bigram is $2$, each one of the two "sandwich" $n$-grams must have length $1$. -->
