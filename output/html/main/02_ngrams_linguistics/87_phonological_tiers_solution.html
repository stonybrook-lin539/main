<div class="exercise">
<p>Write an 11-gram grammar that generates… you know what, no, don’t do
that, life is too short to write 11-gram grammars. Instead, try to
estimate how many <span class="math inline">\(11\)</span>-grams a
negative <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar would need
so that it can generate <em>hasxintilawas</em> and
<em>haʃxintilawaʃ</em> but still rules out <em>hasxintilawaʃ</em> and
<em>haʃxinitilawas</em>. You may make the following simplifying
assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The only vowel and consonants are those that occur in the words
above.</li>
<li>There are no restrictions on the syllable template. That is to say,
each position may be any one of the available vowels and consonants
irrespective of the surrounding context.</li>
</ul>
<div class="solution">
<p>2 billion</p>
</div>
<div class="solution_explained">
<p>The two words contain 10 symbols:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>h</li>
<li>a</li>
<li>s</li>
<li>x</li>
<li>i</li>
<li>n</li>
<li>t</li>
<li>l</li>
<li>w</li>
<li>ʃ</li>
</ol>
<p>A negative 11-gram grammar has to contain all 11-grams that start
with <em>s</em> and end with <em>ʃ</em>, of which there are <span
class="math inline">\(10^9 = 1,000,000,000\)</span> because there are 9
positions between <em>s</em> and <em>ʃ</em>, each one of which can be
filled by one out of the ten symbols above. The grammar also has to
contain all 11-ngrams that start with <em>ʃ</em> and end with
<em>s</em>, of which there are also <span class="math inline">\(10^9 =
1,000,000,000\)</span>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these are just the numbers for generating strings
where <em>s</em> and <em>ʃ</em> are separated by exactly 9 symbols, as
this is all that is needed for a grammar that generates
<em>hasxintilawas</em> and <em>haʃxintilawaʃ</em> but not
<em>hasxintilawaʃ</em> and <em>haʃxinitilawas</em>. If we also want to
cover the cases where the two sibilants are separated by less than 9
symbols, we have to add another <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 9
\times 10^9\)</span> 11-grams to the grammar, for a total of 20 billion
<span class="math inline">\(11\)</span>-grams. That’s quite the grammar
(admittedly we could make the grammar smaller by allowing <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams of varying lengths, but it would
still be huge).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Actually, Samala has even longer words with instances of sibilant
harmony. For example, <em>ʃtajanowonowaʃ</em> is attested whereas
<em>stajanowonowaʃ</em> is illicit. Are 11-grams still enough to handle
this? If not, what is the new value of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and how does that alter your estimate
of a negative <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars size?
Would you say that this is a large grammar?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>The grammar now needs to use 14-grams, and the grammar would have to
contain at least 2 trillion 14-grams (<span class="math inline">\(2
\times 10^12 = 2,000,000,000,000\)</span>). The grammar was already
large before, but this is tremendous increase in size.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Carry out the same calculations for</p>
<ul>
<li><em>haʃxintilawaʃ</em>,</li>
<li><em>haʃxinitilawas</em>, and</li>
<li><em>ʃtajanowonowaʃ</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is to say, write down their tiers (or draw them), and then
indicate whether the tier is well-formed or ill-formed according to the
negative bigram grammar above.</p>
<div class="solution">
<ul>
<li>The sibilant tier of <em>haʃxintilawaʃ</em> is <em>ʃʃ</em>, which is
well-formed.</li>
<li>The sibilant tier of <em>haʃxinitilawas</em> is <em>ʃs</em>, which
is ill-formed.</li>

well-formed.</li>

<p>As an abstract example, suppose that our alphabet consists of <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, and that all symbols except <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> should be projected on the tier. What
is the tier of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{aabaccacb}\)</span>?</p>

<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the strings below, construct its vowel harmony tier
and say whether the tier is well-formed according to the negative bigram
grammar above.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>CBCGBCB</li>
<li>CGMCBCM</li>
<li>CB</li>
</ol>
<div class="solution">

<li>BBB, well-formed</li>

<div class="solution_explained">
<ol type="1">
<li>After removing all instances of C and G from the string, we are left
with BBB, which does not contain any instances of the forbidden bigrams
BM and MB.</li>
<li>Removal of C and G yields the vowel tier MBM, which is clearly
illicit as it contains MB (and also BM).</li>
<li>After removing the single instance of C, we are left with B, which
does not contain any forbidden bigrams.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Now let us also consider words with the neutral vowel class H, for
instance the illicit CBCHCHCM. Do we need to make any modifications to
the vowel harmony tier or the negative bigram grammar? If so, what are
those modifications?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>No, we can keep everything as is. Since neutral vowels do not matter
for the purposes of vowel harmony, they should not be projected onto the
vowel harmony tier. This means that the illicit CBCHCHCM has the tier
BM, which is correctly ruled out as illicit by our unmodified bigram
grammar.</p>

<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following, say whether it is true or false.
Justify your answer.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The size of the negative bigram grammar regulating the vowel harmony
tier is not contingent on the syllable structure of Korean.</li>
<li>The size of the negative bigram grammar regulating the vowel harmony
tier is not contingent on the number of consonants in Korean.</li>
<li>The size of the negative bigram grammar regulating the vowel harmony
tier is not contingent on the number of vowels in Korean.</li>
<li>The size of the negative bigram grammar regulating the vowel harmony
tier is not contingent on any fixed upper bound on the length of
words.</li>
</ol>
<div class="solution">
<ol type="1">
<li>True. Since we only project vowels and ignore other materials like
consonants, syllables can be arbitrarily complex without affecting the
shape of tiers, and consequently the bigram grammar does not need to be
altered.</li>
<li>True. The size of the bigram grammar regulating the shape of tiers
is independent of the number of consonants because consonants are not
projected onto the tier in the first place.</li>
<li>False. While we used abstract symbols like B, M, and H, these are
just shorthands for classes of vowels. Once we replace B, M, and H by
their corresponding vowels, the number of bigrams is contingent on the
overall number of vowels.</li>
<li>True. Two vowels on the vowel harmony tier can be arbitrarily far
apart in the string — for example, CBCM and CBCHCHCHCHCHCHCHCHCM have
exactly the same vowel harmony tier.</li>
