    "\n",
    "We now have a simple model of phonotactics according to which the phonotactic well-formedness can be determined from the chunks that it is built from.\n",
    "In a trigram model, for instance, a word is ill-formed iff it contains one or more illicit trigrams.\n",
    "We formalize this in terms of a negative $n$-gram grammar, which is a finite set of illicit $n$-grams.\n",
    "So far, the models looks rather promising as it can handle a variety of phenomena: word-final devoicing, intervocalic voicing, local assimilation, and various stress rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "For each one of the following phenomena, write a negative $n$-gram grammar that handles it correctly.\n",
    "For some of them, you have to rephrase the phenomenon as a phonotactic constraint first.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>**intervocalic voicing**: voiceless fricatives (assume *s* and *f*) may not occur between vowels (assume *a*, *i*, *u*)</li>\n",
    "<li>**local assimilation**: *n* becomes *m* before *b* or *p*</li>\n",
    "<li>**local disimilation**: *rVr* becomes *lVr*, where V is *a*, *i*, or *u*</li>\n",
    "<li>**penultimate stress**: in words with at least two syllables, stress falls on the last but one syllable (assume that words are strings of stress syllables ($\\acute{\\sigma}$) and unstressed syllables ($\\sigma$))</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the model seems to work well for phonotactics, it is tempting to expand it to other domains.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Morphotactics\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like phonotactics regulates the linear order of sounds in a word, **morphotactics** regulates the linear order of morphemes.\n",
    "Morphemes consist of multiple sounds and are the building blocks of words.\n",
    "For example, *denaturalization* is built from the morphemes *de-*, *nature*, *-al*, *-ize*, and *-ation*.\n",
    "Morphemes cannot be combined willy-nilly, they have to follow a specific order.\n",
    "In the case of *denaturalization*, no other order is possible.\n",
    "Even though the word is built up from 5 elements, which could be arranged in $5! = 5 \\mult 4 \\mult 3 \\mult 2 \\mult 1 = 120$ distinct ways, only one of them is actually allowed by English.\n",
    "So morphotactics defines a very tight rule system for how elements may be ordered in a word, much tighter than phonotactics, where individual sounds have more leeway as to where they occur in a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see if we can write a negative $n$-gram grammar that allows for *denaturalization* but forbids all illicit orders, e.g. *naturedeationizal*.\n",
    "First, we have to pick the basing building blocks for the $n$-grams.\n",
    "For phonotactics, we used $n$-grams where each symbol is a sound, but this is too fine-grained for morphotactics.\n",
    "Instead, we will use $n$-grams where each symbol is a morpheme.\n",
    "So *-ize -ation* is a bigram, not a 6-gram (or 11-gram if one counts characters instead of sounds)."
