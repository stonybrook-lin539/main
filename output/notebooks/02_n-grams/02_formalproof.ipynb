    "\n",
    "The previous two sections introduced negative $n$-gram grammars at great length and showed a basic normal form theorem: for every grammar with $n$-grams of mixed length, there is an equivalent grammar where all $n$-grams have the same length.\n",
    "The presentation was deliberately informal to focus on intuitions rather than mathematical rigor.\n",
    "This unit is very different.\n",
    "It gives the definitions in a mathematical format, rigorously states the normal form theorem, and states the proof of the theorem in a more standard mathematical style.\n",
    "\n",
    "I admit that this might be a lot to take in for the newbie, but it is important for you to learn how to read mathematical notation.\n",
    "It really makes things a lot easier in the long run.\n",
    "Once you feel more comfortable with mathematical notation, I suggest that you come back to this unit and contrast it to the two preceding ones.\n",
    "Which one gives you more information in a short amount of time?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're suffering an acute case of symbol shock, don't worry.\n",
    "We will continue at a leisurely pace, with optional formal sections sprinkled in to give a succinct summary of the more informal sections.\n",

    "A **negative $n$-gram grammar** $G$ over alphabet $\\Sigma$ is a finite set of $n$-grams over $\\Sigma_\\$$.\n",

    "The first bigram is not a problem since there are no strings $u$ and $v$ such that $\\$\\mathit{CVCV}\\$ = u \\stringcat \\mathit{CC} \\stringcat v$.\n",
    "But clearly $\\$\\mathit{CVCV}\\$ = \\$\\mathit{C} \\stringcat \\mathit{VC} \\stringcat \\mathit{V}\\$$.\n",
