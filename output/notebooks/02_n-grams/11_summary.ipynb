    "\n",
    "This unit introduced $n$-grams as a fundamental concepts of computational and theoretical linguistics alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A negative $n$-gram grammar is a set of $n$-grams.\n",
    "    - A string is well-formed iff it does not contain any forbidden $n$-grams.\n",
    "    - An $n$-gram grammar is fixed if all $n$-grams have the same length, and mixed otherwise.\n",
    "- Every negative $n$-gram grammar has an equivalent positive $n$-gram grammar, and the other way round.\n",
    "- Positive grammars must be fixed.\n",
    "- Multiple grammars can be combined into a single grammar.\n",
    "    - Negative grammars: union of sets\n",
    "    - Positive grammars: intersection of sets\n",
    "- Whereas an $n$-gram grammar is a set, a bag of words model is a multiset.\n",
    "    - The multiset counts for each word type its number of word tokens.\n",
    "    - Multiset sum and scalar multiplication can be used to combine and modify counts.\n",
    "- Due to Zipf's law, a small number of words make up the majority of each text.\n",
    "- The function $\\mathrm{del}_S$ removes all stop words.\n",
    "- Mathematically, this is the same as constructing phonological tiers.\n",
    "- Tiers make it possible to handle long-distance dependencies in an elegant fashion with much smaller grammars.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some additional terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have two types of $n$-gram grammars: those that regulate strings, and those that regulate tiers.\n",
    "The former are commonly referred to as **strictly local** (SL) grammars, whereas the latter are **tier-based strictly local** (TSL).\n",
    "A TSL grammar consists of both an SL grammar $G$ and a set $T$ of tier symbols.\n",
    "A string $s$ is well-formed with respect to the TSL grammar iff $\\mathrm{del}_{^+T}(s)$ is well-formed with respect to $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default SL and TSL grammars are negative, but positive counterparts can be defined as usual."
