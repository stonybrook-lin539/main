    "# Proof: Equivalence of positive and negative grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "This section defines both negative and positive versions of $n$-gram grammars and show that they are expressively equivalent.\n",
    "Like in the section on the equivalence of mixed and fixed $n$-gram grammars, this is accomplished by a **constructive** proof.\n",
    "A proof is constructive if it doesn't just derive the existence of some object, but gives a concrete procedure for constructing this object.\n",
    "In the case at hand, the proof shows how to construct a positive grammar from a negative one, and the other way around.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=definition>\n",
    "Let $\\Sigma$ be some alphabet, and $\\Sigma_\\$$ its extension with a distinguished edge marker symbol $\\$$.\n",
    "An $n$-gram over $\\Sigma_\\$$ is an element of $\\Sigma_\\$^n$ ($n \\geq 1$).\n",
    "An $n$-gram grammar $G$ over alphabet $\\Sigma$ is a finite set of $n$-grams over $\\Sigma_\\$$.\n",
    "Every $n$-gram grammar has a **polarity**:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "If $G$ is negative ($^-G$), then a string $s$ over $\\Sigma$ is well-formed with respect to $^-G$ iff there are no $u, v$ over $\\Sigma_\\$$ and no $g \\in ^-G$ such that\n",
    "$ \\$^{n-1} \\stringcat s \\stringcat \\$^{n-1} = u \\stringcat g \\stringcat v$.\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "If $G$ is positive ($^+G$), then a string $s$ over $\\Sigma$ is well-formed with respect to $^+G$ iff for all $u, v$ over $\\Sigma_\\$$ and $g \\in \\Sigma_\\$^n$ such that $\\$^{n-1} \\stringcat s \\stringcat \\$^{n-1} = u \\stringcat g \\stringcat v$, it holds that $g \\in ^+G$.\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "The **language of $G$**, denoted $L(G)$, contains all strings that are well-formed with respect to $G$, and only those.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=theorem>\n",
    "For every $n$-gram grammar $G$ there exists a grammar $G'$ of opposite polarity such that $L(G) = L(G')$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=proof>\n",
    "We assume w.l.o.g. that $G$ is a positive grammar and denote it by $^+G$.\n",
    "We define a negative counterpart $^-G'$ as $\\Sigma_\\$^n - ^+G$ and show that $L(^+G) = L(^-G')$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "First, every $s \\in L(^+G)$ is also a member of $L(^-G')$.\n",
    "Assume towards a contradiction that $s \\notin L(^-G')$.\n",
    "Then there must be some $g \\in ^-G'$ such that $\\$^{n-1} s \\$^{n-1} = u \\stringcat g \\stringcat v$ ($u,v, \\in \\Sigma_\\$^*$).\n",
    "But since $^-G' \\is \\Sigma_\\$^n - ^+G$, it must hold that $g \\notin ^+G$, wherefore $s \\notin L(^+G)$.\n",
    "As this contradicts our initial assumption that $s \\in L(^+G)$, it cannot be the case that $s \\notin L(^-G')$.\n",
    "So $s \\in L(^-G')$ after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In the other direction, suppose that $s \\notin L(^+G)$.\n",
    "Then by definition there are $u, v \\in \\Sigma_\\$^*$ and $\\Sigma_\\$^n \\ni g \\notin ^+G$ such that $\\$^{n-1} s \\$^{n-1} = u \\stringcat g \\stringcat v$.\n",
    "But then $g \\in ^-G'$, which entails $s \\notin L(^-G')$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This shows that $s \\in L(^+G)$ iff $s \\in L(^-G')$.\n",
    "As $s$ was arbitrary, this holds for all strings and establishes $L(^+G) = L(^-G')$, which concludes our proof.\n",
