    "# N-gram models of grammaticality\n",
    "\n",
    "This unit presents a very simple model of language.\n",
    "As you will see, even simple models can give rise to complex questions, questions that cannot easily be answered without math.\n",
    "It might not look like the math you know from high school, but it is still math (some might say it is the high school math that barely qualifies as math because it is about calculating rather than reasoning).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have some mathematical experience, you might want to skip two sections ahead and only come back here to see the linguistic motivation for the mathematics.\n",
    "And the trained linguist may find some of the content here overly simplistic, but we will move on to more intricate problems as our mathematical toolkit grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A simple fact about English\n",
    "\n",
    "English has a large number of different sounds, but not all combinations are possible.\n",
    "For instance, *blink* is a word put *kbinl* is not.\n",
    "And *kbinl* will never be a word of English because it does not obey English *phonotactics*, i.e. the laws that govern the sequence of sounds.\n",
    "This is what separates *kbinl* from *kobinal* or *karbinolium*.\n",
    "None of them are existing words of English, but *kobinal* and *karbinolium* are potential words.\n",
    "We can give them a meaning, start using them, and no native speaker of English will have a problem picking them up.\n",
    "That is because their phonotactics are well-formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The knowledge of English phonotactics is what allows native speakers to coin new terms that fit in with the rest of the vocabulary.\n",
    "It is also what makes it hard for English speakers to learn other languages.\n",
    "German, for example, is very happy to start a word with *k* and *n*, as in *Knoblauch*, the German word for garlic. \n",
    "English has words that are spelled with *kn* at the start, like *knight*, but the *k* is never pronounced.\n",
    "As far as phonotactics is concerned, *knight* and *night* are the same word.\n",
    "Phonotactics is one of the most basic aspects of natural language, and as linguists we want to precisely formulate the laws of phonotactics at both the language-specific level and across languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Language specific**: What are the phonotactics of English? German? Language X?\n",
    "- **General**: What is a possible phonotactic system? What shape can the laws of phonotactics take?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to tackle these questions in a precise manner, we need a formal model of phonotactics.\n",
    "What might that be?\n",
    "It is a safe assumption that a word is phonotactically well-formed iff none of its subparts are ill-formed.\n",
    "So *kobinal* is a possible word because there is nothing wrong with a word that starts with *kobina*, has *obina* in the middle, and ends with *obinal*.\n",
    "But this just raises the question why *kobina* is an acceptable start, *obina* and a well-formed middle, and *obinal* is an acceptable end.\n",
    "Well, because their subparts are fine.\n",
    "For example, *kobina* is fine because a word can start with *kobin* and have *obina* in the middle.\n",
    "Then why can a word start with *kobin*?\n",
    "Well, because its subparts are fine.\n",
    "As you can already see, we can play that game for a long time, breaking well-formed parts into smaller well-formed parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "But eventually, things will break down.\n",
    "If we want to know why *ko* is a good start, it's not enough to say that words can start with *k* and have *o* in the middle.\n",
    "Because it is also true that words can start with *k* and have *b* in the middle (as in *kobinal*), yet *kbinal* is not okay even though it starts with *k* and has a *b* in the middle.\n",
    "By looking at individual sounds, we have decomposed things too much to capture the phonotactics of English.\n",
    "So let's take one step up and consider pairs of consecutive sounds.\n",
    "In more technical terms, let's describe English phonotactics in terms of **bigrams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bigrams\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracting bigrams\n",
    "\n",
    "A bigram is a string of two elements.\n",
    "For phonotactics, the elements are sounds (attention, linguists: we do not need to distinguish between phones, allophones, or phonemes yet, so please don't get your panties in a twist).\n",
    "Examples of bigrams include *ko*, *ob*, or *bn*.\n",

    "But just like English, it does not like words that start with *rb*.\n",
    "We can capture this by writing a trigram grammar for German that contains the forbidden trigram *\\$rb*.\n",
    "But German also has a process known as word-final devoicing: voiced sounds become voiceless at the end of a word.\n",
    "So whereas an English speaker will happily pronounce *woods* with a *z* at the end, a German speaker turns the *z* into an *s* like in *trinkets*.\n",
    "Alright, no big deal, we just forbid *z\\$* too.\n",
    "Or do we?\n",
