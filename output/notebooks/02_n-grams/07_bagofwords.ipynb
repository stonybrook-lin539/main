    "It's impossible for a multiset to contain an item .73 times.\n",
    "In addition, relative frequencies destroy information: an item with frequency .5 could have occurred 5 times, 500, or 5 trillion.\n",
    "It's impossible to tell unless one knows the total size of the corpus that the counts were collected from.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it is best to keep the bag of words untouched and store the frequencies separately.\n",
    "But just for notation, it is often nicer to have frequencies instead of counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
