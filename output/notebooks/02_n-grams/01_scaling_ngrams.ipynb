    "# Analyzing negative $n$-gram grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous unit, we entertained the idea that natural language phonotactics can be described in terms of a collection of forbidden sound sequences.\n",
    "Such a collection is called a forbidden $n$-gram grammar, and each $n$-gram represents one forbidden sound sequence of length $n$.\n",
    "But this idea ran into a problem.\n",
    "In German, words cannot start with *rb*, which is captured by adding the trigram *\\$rb* to the list of illicit $n$-grams (*\\$* is a special symbol that indicates the edge of a word).\n",
    "But German also has word-final devoicing, which means that no word can end in a voiced *s*-sound, which corresponds to *z* in English orthography.\n",
    "Using this notational convention, we can represent the illicit sequence as *z\\$*.\n",
    "This is a bigram, whereas *\\$rb* is a trigram.\n",
    "What are the consequences of mixing bigrams and trigrams in a single $n$-gram grammar?\n",
    "Does this introduce inconsistencies such that a word is both forbidden and allowed? \n",
    "\n",
    "## A plea for proofs\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you're a mathematician, your first instinct will be to work through one or more examples.\n",
    "If we, say, construct 100 grammars that include bigrams and trigrams and don't run into any problems, it's probably fine to mix and match. \n",
    "But this has several downsides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **So much work...**  \n",
    "  Constructing and testing 100 grammars doesn't exactly sound like fun.\n",
    "  Sure, you could write a program to do it for you, but that's also work.\n",
    "  And your program might have bugs, which takes us to the next point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No guarantees**  \n",
    "  Just because your simulations produce a certain result does not mean that things always work this way.\n",
    "  If you ask 1000 people if they've ever read Werner Schwab's *FÃ¤kaliendramen* (feces dramas), the answers will probably all be No unless your sample happened to include some literature buffs.\n",
    "  Similarly, the grammars you construct for your simulation might exhibit a special property that allows them to pass the test.\n",
    "  There might still be grammars that do not display this property and fail.\n",
    "  If you construct the grammars with a program, your code might be written in a way that it only produces grammar of a specific type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No scalability**  \n",
    "  Alright, suppose you actually wrote a program that is free of any bias and ran a huge number of simulations for grammar with mixed bigrams and trigrams.\n",
    "  You now feel very confident that mixing of bigrams and trigrams is unproblematic.\n",
    "  What about 4-grams?\n",
    "  5-grams?\n",
    "  127-grams?\n",
    "  How do you know that your results will carry over from bigrams and trigrams to arbitrary $n$-grams?\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulations are *en vogue* nowadays, but they're really a last resort.\n",
    "They are hard to design, often require significant computational resources, and do not provide perfect insight into how the specific aspects of a system determine its behavior.\n",
    "That's not to say that simulations are a bad thing - if you are dealing with a very complex system, they're often the best tool at your disposal.\n",
    "But there are other tools around, and in many cases they are a superior choice.\n",
    "Mathematics furnishes the best tool of them all: proofs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mathematical proof starts out from a fixed set of assumptions and shows how these assumptions entail a specific property.\n",
    "We will see a concrete example in a moment, but let's first focus on the specific advantages of proofs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Laziness**  \n",
    "  Hard proofs are very, very hard.\n",
    "  They are much harder than designing a simulation.\n",
    "  But unless you are a professional mathematician, most proofs you'll ever see are fairly easy.\n",
    "  And easy proofs are very, very easy.\n",
    "  You can often work them out in less than 30 minutes, and they only take a few lines to write down.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Guarantees**  \n",
    "  Of course a proof may contain mistakes, just like a program may contain bugs.\n",
    "  But mistakes in a proof are easier to spot than bugs in a program.\n",
    "  Fixing a proof is also much simpler than verifying that a simulation has no hidden biases.\n",
    "  Once you have a correct proof, you have a guarantee: as long as the assumptions of the proof hold, the property established by proof holds, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**\n",
    "  Since a proof holds as long as its initial assumptions are satisfied, it can be extended to any object that satisfies these assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may all sound awfully abstract to you, so let's finally turn to our first proof.\n",
    "We will show that a negative $n$-gram grammar that also contains, say, bigrams and trigrams can be converted to an equivalent $n$-gram grammar that only contains $n$-grams.\n",
    "While reading through the proof, keep in mind the three properties above (laziness, guarantees, scalability), and think about how they're instantiated in the proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our first proof: Mixed $n$-gram grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formalizing the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial question is whether there is any problem with mixing bigrams and trigrams in a single grammar.\n",
    "This is not a very precise question.\n",
    "What exactly constitutes a problem?\n",
    "If you have to write on a tiny piece of paper that can barely hold a single bigram, adding a trigram to the mix creates problems.\n",
    "That's obviously not our concern here.\n",
    "Remember that we use negative $n$-gram grammars as a model of natural language phonotactics.\n",
    "So their job is to describe which potential words are well-formed and which are ill-formed.\n",
    "We would have a problem if this failed for some reason: a word is both well-formed or ill-formed, a word that is ill-formed suddenly becomes well-formed when bigrams and trigrams are mixed, or the other way round.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show that none of these issues ever arise; we do so by establishing a **normal form theorem**.\n",
    "Whenever a grammar contains $n$-grams of different sizes, it can be converted to a grammar where all $n$-grams are of the same size.\n",
    "This converted grammar is equivalent to the original in the sense that they make the same phonotactic judgments: the first grammar deems a word well-formed iff the second one does, too, and the two also agree on which words are ill-formed.\n",
    "The second grammar thus behaves exactly like the first, but has a normalized form without any $n$-grams of different length.\n",
    "That's why the second grammar is called a **normal form** of the first one.\n",
    "**Theorem** is just a fancy term for a statement that follows from a fixed set of assumptions.\n",
    "So we are proving a theorem about the existence of a normal form, hence the term normal form theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to avoid an overload of notation and terminology, we state the theorem in a slightly inaccurate manner as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=theorem>\n",
    "    Let $G$ be some collection of sound $n$-grams of different lengths where $k$ is the length of the longest $n$-gram.\n",
    "    Then there exists an equivalent grammar $G'$ such that every $n$-gram of $G'$ has length $k$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with a few key observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every language has only finitely many sounds.\n",
    "  The precise number does not matter here, it could be 2, it could be 2 trillion trillion.\n",
    "  The important thing is that it is finite.\n",
    "  We use $\\card{\\Sigma}$ as the special symbol for this number.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "  If a language only has the sounds *a*, *u*, *i*, *b*, *m*, *d*, *g*, and *h*, then $\\card{\\Sigma}$ for that specific language is $8$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "- As stated in the theorem, the longest $n$-gram is assumed to have length $k$.\n",
    "  Since each position is filled by either a sound or the edge marker *\\$*, there are $\\card{\\Sigma} + 1$ choices for each position.\n",
    "  Consequently, there are at most $(\\card{\\Sigma}+1)^k$ different $n$-grams of length $k$.\n",
    "  This implies that $G$ contains at most $(\\card{\\Sigma}+1)^k$ $n$-grams and thus contains only finitely many.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Suppose that the language only has *a*, *d*, barely enough for *dada*.\n",
    "It's $\\card{\\Sigma}^k$ is $2$.\n",
    "There are $(2+1)^3 = 3^3 = 27$ different trigrams:\n",

    "It's very long, and it's cumbersome to read and make sense of the sentences.\n",
    "But that's because everything was explained in plain English rather than mathematical notation.\n",
    "This made the proof harder to read and much longer, and it also means that we had to rely on examples to explain what exactly is intended at each step of the proof.\n",
    "The next unit will present the same proof in mathematical notation, and while it may be initially harder for you, this format will be a lot easier for you once you have some experience.\n",

    "In fact, this is why it is so helpful to learn math.\n",
    "Many things are intuitive enough that they can be explained in plain English.\n",
    "But it is clumsy, imprecise, and takes longer.\n",
    "Specialized notation and terminology makes things easier to talk and think about, not harder."
