    "# Combining $n$-gram grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, our short expedition has resulted in a few formal insights into $n$-gram grammars, but also a variety of examples of how they can be used in linguistics.\n",
    "However, all the examples were limited to specific phenomena.\n",
    "If $n$-gram grammars are supposed to provide a model of phonotactics or morphotactics, it isn't enough to show that individual phenomena in those domains can be described with those grammars.\n",
    "We already know that word-final devoicing can be handled by $n$-gram grammars, and the same is true for penultimate stress.\n",
    "But a speaker whose language displays both phenomena must have some grammar that takes care of both.\n",
    "Is this combined grammar also an $n$-gram grammar?\n",
    "It is not immediately obvious that the answer to that is yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other types of grammars for which the answer is no.\n",
    "Later on, we will encounter context-free grammars (CFGs).\n",
    "For CFGs, it is not the case that what can be jointly accomplished by two grammars can be done by a single grammar.\n",
    "The problem is mostly limited to artificial languages (which is interesting in itself - apparently all natural languages have some special property that avoids this problem).\n",
    "But it nonetheless shows that one cannot model each phenomenon with its own grammar and simply assume that they can all be combined into a single grammar of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Consider the language $L_\\mathit{ab} \\is a^n b^n c^+$.\n",
    "This language only contains strings of the form *ab$\\delta$*, *aabb$\\delta$*, *aaabbb$\\delta$*, and so on, where $\\delta$ is a shorthand for 1 or more *c*s.\n",
    "So this language contains strings like *aabbc*, **abcccc*, or *aaaabbbbcc*, but not *abbc*.\n",
    "Intuitively, $L_\\mathit{ab}$ is the language of strings where all $a$ occur before all *b*s, all *b*s occur before all *c*s, and the number of *a*s and *b*s must match.\n",
    "A very similar language is $L_\\mathit{bc} \\is a^+ b^n c^n$, where the number of *a*s is irrelevant and instead the number of *b*s and *c*s must match.\n",
    "It is easy to show that there is a CFG that generates $L_\\mathit{ab}$, and similarly that there is a CFG that generates $L_\\mathit{bc}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "But now consider what happens if we put all those conditions together.\n",
    "This yields the language $L_\\mathit{abc} \\is a^n b^n c^n$, where the number of *a*s must match the number of *b*s and the number of *b*s must match the number of *c*s.\n",
    "So *aabbcc* would be a string of $L_\\mathit{abc}$, but not *abbcc*, *abbc*, or *aaabbc*.\n",
    "This language cannot be generated by a CFG.\n",
    "Even though each individual matching condition can be captured by a CFG, their combination cannot.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, $n$-gram grammars are not like CFGs and can be combined in a very simple fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Combining negative grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have two negative bigram grammars that you want to combine into a single bigram grammar.\n",
    "The first thing to be clarified here is what we mean by combine.\n",
    "Given two grammars $G$ and $G'$, their combination could accept every string that is generated by both grammars, or every string that is generated by at least one grammar.\n",
    "The former is much more restrictive than the latter.\n",
    "It is like saying \"each one of these grammars imposes a constraint, and we combine the constraints into a single grammar that enforces them all at once\".\n",
    "The other option instead allows for violations: \"there's a bunch of phenomena, and as long as a string obeys exhibits at least one of them, it is well-formed\".\n",
    "This is not how natural languages work.\n",
    "If a language has both word-final devoicing and intervocalic voicing, then a word has to satisfy both.\n",
    "You cannot say \"Oh, I already did the intervocalic voicing, so let's not bother with the word-final devoicing\".\n",
    "Language is like an exam where you get an F unless you answer every single question correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, we only have to consider the stricter way of combining grammars, the one where the resulting grammar only generates strings that are well-formed with respect to each one of the original grammars.\n",
    "Such a combined grammar is actually very easy to build: construct a new negative $n$- grammar that contains every $n$-gram that belongs to at least one of the original negative grammars.\n",
    "In set-theoretic terms, this amounts to taking the union of the two negative grammars.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Suppose that we have a negative bigram grammar $G_1$ for word-final devoicing that contains only the bigram *s\\$*.\n",
    "In set notation, $G_1 \\is \\setof{\\text{s\\$}}$.\n",
    "This grammar rules out every string that ends in an *s*.\n",
    "Furthermore, let $G_2$ be a negative trigram grammar for intervocalic voicing.\n",
    "It contains the trigrams *asa*, *asi*, *isa*, and *isi* (a realistic grammar would of course require more than just those four trigrams).\n",
    "So $G_2$ forbids every string where *s* occurs between the vowels *a* and *i*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In order to obtain a grammar that enforces both constraints, one simply constructs a new grammar $G$ that contains all these $n$-grams: *s\\$*, *asa*, *asi*, *isa*, *isi*.\n",
    "Every string that is ruled out by $G_1$ or $G_2$ is also ruled out by $G$.\n",
    "And every string that is allowed by $G$ is allowed by both $G_1$ and $G_2$.\n",
    "If desired, we can convert $G$ from a mixed grammar to a fixed one using the familiar padding procedure from an earlier unit.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can express this insight in terms of a formal theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=theorem>\n",
    "Let $G_1$ be a negative $m$-gram grammar, $G_2$ a negative $n$-gram grammar ($m$ and $n$ may be the same).\n",
    "Then $L(G_1) \\cap L(G_2) = L(G_1 \\cup G_2)$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us look in detail at how this theorem uses mathematical notation to express our idea about combining grammars.\n",
    "Recall that $L(G)$ is the set of strings that are well-formed with respect to $G$.\n",
    "The intersection $A \\cap B$ of two sets $A$ and $B$ contains all elements that occur in both $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "This is in contrast to the union $A \\cup B$, which contains all elements that occur in at least one of the two, $A$ or $B$.\n",
    "So $L(G_1) \\cap L(G_2)$ is the set of strings that belong to both $L(G_1)$ and $L(G_2)$.\n",
    "In other words, these strings are well-formed with respect to both $G_1$ and $G_2$.\n",
    "The theorem tells us that these are exactly the strings that are well-formed with respect to some other grammar that is the union of $G_1$ and $G_2$.\n",
    "This makes sense because we have defined $n$-gram grammars as finite sets, so set-theoretic operations like union can be applied to these grammars like to any other set.\n",
    "\n",
    "That negative $n$-gram grammars are this easy to combine is a huge advantage.\n",
    "It means that when faced with a complex system like natural language phonotactics, we can safely decompose it into simpler subsystems and design a grammar for each one of them.\n",
    "The overall system is then obtained in a purely mechanical fashion by taking the union of the grammars for these subsystems.\n",
    "Not only does this greatly simplify the linguistic analysis step, it also helps with real-world implementations.\n",
    "For each phenomenon one designs a small grammar that can be easily tested for correctness, and only once all components have been individually verified does one combine them into the full model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "Write two negative grammars such that the first only generates *ab* and *ba*, whereas the latter generates all strings of the form *ab*, *aab*, *aaab*, and so on.\n",
    "Then build the corresponding combined grammar.\n",
    "What is the language generated by the combined grammar?\n",
    "Is this the correct result?\n",
    "</div>\n",

    "## Extension to positive grammars via De Morgan's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining grammars by taking their union only gives the desired result for negative grammars.\n",
    "For positive grammars, one has to take their intersection instead.\n",
    "(And since positive grammars always require a fixed $n$-gram length, one has to make sure first that the $n$-grams have the same length across all grammars.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=theorem>\n",
    "Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be positive $n$-gram grammars.\n",

    "Okay, then here is a very different way to think about it.\n",
    "The set operations of intersection and union are intimately connected via another operation called relative complement.\n",
    "The complement of $B$ with respect to $A$, written $A - B$, contains all elements of $A$ that aren't also members of $B$.\n",
    "Given some fixed universe $U$, one usually writes $\\overline{A}$ instead of $U - A$.\n",
    "It then holds that $A \\cap B = \\overline{\\overline{A} \\cup \\overline{B}}$ and $A \\cup B = \\overline{\\overline{A} \\cap \\overline{B}}$.\n",
