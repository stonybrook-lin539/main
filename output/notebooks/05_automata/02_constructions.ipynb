    "## Intersection\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two FSAs $A$ and $B$ that recognize the languages $L(A)$ and $L(B)$, respectively, one can construct an automaton $A \\cap B$ that recognizes $L(A) \\cap L(B)$.\n",
    "This shows that the class of regular languages is closed under intersection.\n",
    "Closure under intersection is an incredibly valuable property because it means that a complex pattern can be factored into simpler patterns such that the intersection of all the simple patterns produces the complex pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The construction of $A \\cap B$ is actually fairly simple as it all amounts to constructing an automaton that runs $A$ and $B$ in parallel.\n",
    "But one thing after another:\n",
    "intuitively, a string $s$ is in the intersection of $L(A)$ and $L(B)$ only if there is an accepting run of $A$ over $s$ and an accepting run of $B$ over $s$.\n",
    "So if we were to run $A$ and $B$ in parallel, both would have to end up in a final state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine this in an even more visual manner. \n",
    "Suppose our automata $A$ and $B$ are as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![med](abaa.svg)\n",
    "![med](modulo4_ab.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $A$ recognizes strings of the form $\\String{a(baa)^*}$ (where $^*$ means 0 or more iteration of the bracketed part).\n",
    "And $B$ recognizes any string over $a$ and $b$ whose length is a multiple of $4$.\n",
    "So $abaa$ would be recognized by both and thus in the intersection of $L(A)$ and $L(B)$, whereas $a$ would be rejected by $B$ and $abab$ would be rejected by $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that you put your left index finger on the initial state of $A$, and your right index finger on the initial state of $B$.\n",
    "Move your fingers in parallel as you move along with the symbols in $\\String{abaa}$.\n",
    "So after the first $a$ your finger moves from $0$ to $1$ in $A$, and from $0$ to $1$ in $B$.\n",
    "Then the $b$ pushes your finger from $1$ to $2$ in $A$, and similarly in $B$.\n",
    "After the next $a$ your finger moves from $2$ to $0$ in $A$, and from $2$ to $3$ in $B$.\n",
    "Finally, the last $a$ shifts you from $0$ to $1$ in $A$, and from $3$ to $0$ in $B$.\n",
    "Both are final states, and thus the string is recognized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this intuition, we construct an automaton where each state keeps track of the position of our fingers in these two automata.\n",
    "For the string above, we start out in $0,0$ and move to $1,1$ with an $a$ transition.\n",
    "After that a $b$ transition moves us to $2,2$, from which another $a$ gets us to $0,3$, and from there to $1,0$.\n",
    "For any two states $a,x$ and $b,y$, there is a $\\sigma$-transition from $a,x$ to $b,y$ iff there is a $\\sigma$-transition from $a$ to $b$ and in the first automaton and a $\\sigma$-transition from $x$ to $y$ in the second automaton. \n",
    "Furthermore, a state $a,x$ is initial iff both $a$ and $x$ are initial, and it is final iff both $a$ and $x$ are final.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying this construction to the two automata above yields the following:\n",

    "In this case, a single string containing the symbol $\\sigma$ may have multiple runs because we can move from $q$ to $u$ or to $v$.\n",

    "Determinism is a very desirable property.\n",
    "Not only does it simplify certain proofs, it also is essential for efficient recognition.\n",
    "With a deterministic automaton, recognition proceeds in real-time.\n",
    "Just as in a prefix tree, we can immediately start moving through the automaton as the symbols of the string are read in.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a non-deterministic automaton, recognition is more complex.\n",
    "Suppose we reach a fork where we could move from $u$ to $v$ or $w$.\n",
    "We could try $v$, and if we're lucky this is the correct path.\n",
    "But if we do not make it to a final state along this path, we have to backtrack to $u$ and try $w$ instead.\n",
    "Since each state may have many different choice points, recognition becomes much slower.\n",
    "If every state has at most $m$ choice points, recognition of a string of length $n$ can take up to $m^n$ steps.\n",
    "That is truly awful, with $m = 4$ and a short string of length $5$ this may already require $4^5 = (2^2)^5 = 2^10 = 1024$ steps instead of just $5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to this kind of serial search is to do parallel search: whenever we reach a state with $m$ choices, we make $m$ copies of the automaton and each copy proceeds along of the possible paths.\n",
    "Now recognition can again proceed in real-time (modulo the cost of spawning copies of the automaton), but we consume a lot of memory.\n",
    "This situation is very common in software engineering, and it is known as a time-space tradeoff: either we do it slow but memory-efficient, or we do it fast but at a much higher memory cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The copy-spawning idea can be compiled directly into a non-deterministic automaton by **determinizing** it.\n",
    "The idea isn't too dissimilar from the construction of the intersection automaton: each state consists of multiple components that encode the state of one of the spawned copies.\n",
    "The construction makes some tweaks though to reduce state bloat.\n",
    "If one were to represent the state configuration of $m$ copies of the FSA as an $m$-tuple of states, then one could easily end up with $m$-tuples that contain many redundant components.\n",
    "For example, the states $\\tuple{u,v,u}$ and $\\tuple{u,u,v}$ encode the same information: one copy is in state $v$, the other two in state $u$.\n",
    "Since all copies are exactly the same automaton, there is no point in maintaining two copies that are both in state $u$.\n",
    "Instead, states are chosen from $2^Q$.\n",
    "A state like $\\setof{u}$ encodes that we only need one copy of the machine, which is in state $u$.\n",
    "If we then transition from $\\setof{u}$ to $\\setof{v,w}$, that is tantamount to saying \"we had a single automaton in state $u$, and then we spawned a copy so that we now have one automaton in state $v$ and one in state $w$\".\n",
    "And if we switch from $\\setof{v,w}$ to $\\setof{x}$, this means that both copies of the automato moved into state $x$ so we destroyed one of them because it had become redundant.\n",
