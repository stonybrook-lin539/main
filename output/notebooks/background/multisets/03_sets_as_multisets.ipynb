    "# Sets as instances of multisets\n",
    "\n",
    "Multisets are a natural generalization of sets.\n",
    "But if this is true, then sets should fall out as just a special case of multisets.\n",
    "Let us see if this is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, every set $S$ can be regarded as a multiset with co-domain $\\mathbb{N}$ but range $\\setof{0,1}$.\n",
    "All the members of $S$ are mapped to $1$, everything else to $0$.\n",
    "So far so good.\n",
    "Now consider the set operations union, intersection, and relative complement.\n",
    "For multisets $A_M$ and $B_M$, $A_M \\cup B_M$ maps every $a$ to $\\max(A_M(a), B_M(a))$.\n",
    "For sets, the only two possible values for $A_M(a)$ and $B_M(a)$ are $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "Let's consider each scenario in turn with union:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $a \\in A$, $a \\in B$, so $a \\in A \\cup B$; then $A_M(a) = B_M(a) = 1$, and $\\max(1,1) = 1$, whence $a \\in A_M \\cup B_M$.\n",
    "- $a \\in A$, $a \\notin B$, so $a \\in A \\cup B$; then $A_M(a) = 1$, $B_M(a) = 0$, and $\\max(1,0) = 1$, whence $a \\in A_M \\cup B_M$.\n",
    "- $a \\notin A$, $a \\in B$, so $a \\in A \\cup B$; then $A_M(a) = 0$, $B_M(a) = 1$, and $\\max(1,0) = 1$, whence $a \\in A_M \\cup B_M$.\n",
    "- $a \\notin A$, $a \\notin b$, so $a \\notin A \\cup B$; then $A_M(a) = 0$, $B_M(a) = 0$, and $\\max(0,0) = 0$, whence $a \\notin A_M \\cup B_M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intersection and relative complement work in exactly the same fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the formula for cardinality works as expected: given a set $A$, $\\card{A}$ is the number of elements it contains, whereas $\\card{A_M}$ is the sum of the counts of each element.\n",
    "But since every $a \\in A_M$ has a count of $1$, this sum is the same as $\\card{A}$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    \\card{A_M}  & = \\sum_{a \\in A_M} A_M(a)\\\\\n",
    "                & = A_M(a_1) + \\cdots + A_M(a_n)\\\\\n",
    "                & = 1 + \\cdots + 1\\\\\n",
    "                & = \\card{A}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can even confirm why the cardinality of the powerset of some set $S$ must be $2^\\card{S}$.\n",
    "The formula for calculating the cardinality of the powerset of a multiset $S_M$ is $\\prod_{s \\in S_M} (S_M(s) + 1)$.\n",
    "Every member of a set has a count of $1$, for a set $S$ this formula expands to $\\prod_{s \\in S} (1 + 1) = \\prod_s{ \\in S}$.\n",
    "So if $S$ has $n$ members, the cardinality of $\\wp(S)$ is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\underbrace{2 \\times \\cdots \\times 2}_{n \\text{ times}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "But that is the same as $2^n$, which is the same as $2^\\card{S}$.\n",
    "It all fits together exactly as it should.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that multisets are indeed a faithful generalization of sets.\n",
    "And it also gives us a good example of how one and the same object can be viewed in multiple ways."
