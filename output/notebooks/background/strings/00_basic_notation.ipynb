    "They are $\\Sigma^*$ and $\\Sigma^+$, respectively.\n",

    "The only difference between the two is that $\\Sigma^*$ also contain the **empty string** $\\emptystring$.\n",
    "The empty string is the string counterpart of the number 0: it represents nothing.\n",

    "Here's a little bit of background to make it easier for you to remember the difference between $\\Sigma^*$ and $\\Sigma^+$.\n",
    "As you might know from search engines, the Kleene star `*` is sometimes used as a wildcard that matches everything.\n",
    "So $\\Sigma^*$ can be translated as \"every string built over $\\Sigma$\".\n",
    "On the other hand $\\Sigma^+$ only contains those strings whose length is at least 1, or in other words, whose length is positive.\n",
    "And $+$ is a common abbreviation for positive (just think of batteries).\n",

    "\n",
    "Given two $\\Sigma$-strings $u$ and $v$, their **concatenation** $u \\stringcat v$ is the result of \"glueing\" the left end of $v$ to the right end of $u$.\n",

    "<li>$\\text{Thomas} \\stringcat \\text{Graf} = \\text{ThomasGraf}$.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though concatenation is associative, it is not commutative.\n",
    "That is to say, $u \\stringcat v$ and $v \\stringcat u$ are not necessarily the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Let $u \\is \\text{house}$ and $v \\is \\text{boat}$.\n",
    "Then $u \\stringcat v$ is *houseboat*, whereas $v \\stringcat u$ is *boathouse*.\n",
    "Those are not the same strings (and they also happen to mean completely different things).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the special behavior of the empty string: $u \\stringcat \\emptystring = \\emptystring \\stringcat u = u$. \n",
    "This makes sense: adding nothing to $u$ does not change $u$, just like adding 0 to a number does not change that number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes concatenation is not explicitly indicated, so that instead of $u \\stringcat v$ one may simply write $\\mathit{uv}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "Given an example of distinct $u$ and $v$ such that $u \\stringcat v = v \\stringcat u$ and neither $u$ nor $v$ is the empty string.\n",
