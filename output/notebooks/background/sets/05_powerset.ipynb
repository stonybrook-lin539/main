    "# The Powerset\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is useful to take a set and consider all sets one could build from its elements.\n",
    "For example, each one of the following sets can be built form the elements of $\\setof{1,2,3}$: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\emptyset$\n",
    "1. $\\setof{1}$\n",
    "1. $\\setof{2}$\n",
    "1. $\\setof{3}$\n",
    "1. $\\setof{1,2}$\n",
    "1. $\\setof{1,3}$\n",
    "1. $\\setof{2,3}$\n",
    "1. $\\setof{1,2,3}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each one of the sets in this list is a subset of $\\setof{1,2,3}$, and every subset of $\\setof{1,2,3}$ is on this list.\n",
    "So the above is the list of all subsets of $\\setof{1,2,3}$.\n",
    "The set of all these sets is called the *powerset* of $\\setof{1,2,3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=definition>\n",
    "    For $A$ a set, the *powerset* of $A$ is $\\wp(A) \\is \\setof{ S \\mid S \\subseteq A }$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many alternative notations for the powerset.\n",
    "A particularly common one is $2^A$ as it highlights two interesting aspects of the powerset.\n",
    "First, we define the *cardinality* of a set $A$ as the number of elements it contains, and we denote it by $\\card{A}$.\n",
    "For example, $\\card{\\setof{1,2,3}} = 3$.\n",
    "Now we can state a universal truth for the cardinality of powersets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=theorem>\n",
    "    For every set $A$ with $\\card{A} = n$, it holds that $\\card{\\wp(A)} = \\card{2^A} = 2^\\card{A} = 2^n$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is witnessed by our example set $\\setof{1,2,3}$, the powerset of which has $8$ members (see the list above).\n",
    "Feel free to compute the powerset of $\\setof{1,2}$ and $\\setof{1,2,3,4}$, you will see that they have $4$ and $16$ members, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the $2^A$ notation for powersets has a deeper meaning that goes beyond mere numbers.\n",
    "The notation $B^A$ is sometimes used to represent the set of all functions from $A$ to $B$.\n",
    "And $2$ can be construed not just as the number $2$, but as any set with cardinality $2$, including $\\setof{\\top, \\bot}$.\n",
    "So $2^A$ can be taken to denote the set of all functions from $A$ to $\\setof{\\top, \\bot}$.\n",
    "But since functions are sets, this is exactly the class of all subsets of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, the $2^A$ notation for powersets is very pleasing on a theoretical level.\n",
    "But humans are a practical bunch, and since superscripts are slightly strenuous to read, $\\wp(A)$ is the preferred notation for powersets."
