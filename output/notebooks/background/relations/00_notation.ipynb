    "# Relations\n",
    "\n",
    "Relations are similar to functions in that they establish connections between objects.\n",
    "But whereas a function associates only one output with every input, a relation is more flexible and allows connections to arbitrarily many elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "The question *Is $x$ a biological child of $y$* is a function because it maps any two $x$ and $y$ to either true or false, but never both.\n",
    "But if we slightly change the question to just *Name a biological child of $y$*, we are no longer dealing with a function because multiple answers are possible if $y$ has more than one child.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Suppose *John* has exactly two siblings, *Mary* and *Sue*.\n",
    "Then the sibling relation establishes two connections for John: *John*-*Mary*, and *John*-*Sue*.\n",
    "This is commonly encoded as tuples: $\\tuple{\\text{John}, \\text{Mary}}$ and $\\tuple{\\text{John}, \\text{Sue}}$.\n",
    "For this particular family, the whole sibling relation can be represented as a set of pairs $\\tuple{x,y}$ such that $x$ is the sibling of $y$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\setof{ \\tuple{x,y} \\mid x,y \\in \\setof{\\text{John}, \\text{Mary}, \\text{Sue}}, \\text{ and } x \\neq y}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "The **substring relation** $\\sqsubseteq$ holds between two strings $u$ and $v$ iff $u$ is a substring of $v$.\n",
    "That is to say, there are $w, w' \\in \\Sigma^*$ such that $w \\stringcat u \\stringcat w' = v$.\n",
    "Note that for any given string $u$, there are infinitely many $v$ that $u$ is a substring of.\n",
    "Even if the alphabet contains only $a$, the string $aa$ is a substring of $aaa$, $aaaa$, $aaaaa$, and so on, ad infinitum.\n",
    "It is also a substring of itself (in this case, $w = w' = \\emptystring$).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Just like a function can take multiple arguments to return a single output, a relation can connect multiple elements.\n",
    "In the real world, the \"jointly conceived\" relation would connect two individuals to their offspring.\n",
    "So $\\tuple{\\text{John}, \\text{Mary}, \\text{Sue}}$ encodes that John and Mary are the biological parents of Sue (let's just hope that those are not the same people as in the first example).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition and notation\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=definition>\n",
    "A **relation** is a (possibly empty, possibly infinite) set of $n$-tuples.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will mostly be dealing with the special case of **binary relations**, where $n = 2$.\n",
    "Given a binary relation $R$, $a \\mathrel{R}$ and $\\mathrel{R} b$ are sets of objects related to $a$ and $b$, respectively:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a \\mathrel{R} \\is \\setof{ b \\mid \\tuple{a,b} \\in R}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrel{R} b \\is \\setof{ a \\mid \\tuple{a,b} \\in R}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Suppose that the parent-of relation $P$ contains only the pairs\n",
    "$\\tuple{\\text{John}, \\text{Sue}}$\n",
    "and\n",
    "$\\tuple{\\text{Mary}, \\text{Sue}}$.\n",
    "Then $\\text{John} \\mathrel{P} = \\setof{\\text{Sue}}$ and $\\mathrel{P} \\text{Sue} = \\setof{ \\text{John}, \\text{Mary}}$.\n",

    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "Let $R$ be the relation that connects words to their parts of speech (N for nouns, V for verbs, A for adjectives, P for prepositions, D for determiners, and so on).\n",
    "List the following for English:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>export $R$</li>\n",

    "## Relations versus functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Every function can be regarded as a relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Consider the function $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ with $x \\mapsto 2x$.\n",
    "It is identical to the relation $\\setof{ \\tuple{x, 2x} \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{N}}$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial difference is that functions are **right-unique relations**.\n",
    "That is to say, it holds for every $a$ that $a \\mathrel{R}$ is either empty or contains exactly one element.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "For each one of the following, say whether it is a function or just a relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>the parent-of relation</li>\n",
    "<li>the parent-of relation in a world where the one-child policy is enforced globally</li>\n",
    "<li>the relation between a car's license plate and its owners</li>\n",
    "<li>the prefix relation, where $u$ is a prefix of $v$ iff there is some $w \\in \\Sigma^*$ such that $v = u \\stringcat w$</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "Is the following statement true or false?\n",
    "Justify your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Every relation $R$ can be regarded as a function that maps $x$ to $x \\mathrel{R}$.\n",
