    "As you might already expect, propositional logic also has the structure of a Boolean lattice.\n",
    "All we have to do is figure out the carrier set, and the rest will follow immediately.\n",
    "First, let $L$ be the set of all propositional formulas.\n",
    "We define an ordering $\\leq$ such that $\\phi \\leq \\psi$ ($\\phi, \\psi \\in L$) iff $\\phi$ always entails $\\psi$.\n",
    "In other words, $\\phi \\leq \\psi$ iff $\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi$ is a tautology.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're almost done, but not quite.\n",
    "Note that $\\tuple{L, \\leq}$ is not a poset because antisymmetry is violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Consider the formulas $a$ and $\\neg \\neg a$.\n",
    "Clearly $a \\rightarrow \\neg \\neg a$ and $\\neg \\neg a \\rightarrow a$. \n",
    "So we ahve $a \\leq \\neg \\neg a$ and $\\neg \\neg a \\leq a$, yet $a$ and $\\neg \\neg a$ are distinct memebers of $L$. \n",
    "This contradicts antisymmetry.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to fix this, we instead look at the quotient structure $\\tuple{L_\\sim, \\leq}$, where $\\phi \\sim \\psi$ iff $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ entail each other.\n",
    "So $L_\\sim$ consists of equivalence classes of propositional formulas whose truth values never differ from each other.\n",
    "Strictly speaking, we have to define $\\leq$ for this new set $L_\\sim$, but the idea is simple: $[\\phi] \\leq [\\psi]$ iff $\\phi$ entails $\\psi$.\n",
    "That is to say, we can order any two equivalence classes by looking at the entailment between their respective members.\n",
    "This makes $\\tuple{L_\\sim, \\leq}$ a poset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a unique least element, the equivalence class $[a \\wedge \\neg a]$, or simply $[\\bot]$.\n",
    "And there is a unique greatest element $[a \\vee \\neg a]$, or simply $[\\top]$.\n",
    "Any two elements $[\\phi]$ and $[\\psi]$ have a unique join $[\\phi \\vee \\psi]$, and a unique meet $[\\phi \\wedge \\psi]$.\n",
    "So the lattice operations of join ($\\vee$) and meet ($\\wedge$) correspond exactly to logical or ($\\vee$) and logical and ($\\wedge$).\n",
    "We already know that the latter are distributive, and it is also easy to see that for every $[\\phi] \\in L$ there is some complement $\\neg [\\phi] \\in L$ such that $[\\phi] \\wedge \\neg [\\phi] = [\\bot]$ and $[\\phi] \\vee \\neg [\\phi] = [\\top]$.\n",
    "In fact, this complement $\\neg [\\phi]$ is simply $[\\neg \\phi]$, showing the close connection between logical negation and complement in this structure.\n",
    "Overall, then, $\\tuple{L_\\sim, \\leq}$ is a poset where any two elements have a unique join and meet, where join and meet distribute over each, with unique least and greatest bounds, and a complement for every element of the $L_\\sim$.\n",
    "That's just a very roundabout way of saying that $\\tuple{L_\\sim, \\leq}$ is a Boolean lattice, just like $\\tuple{\\wp(S), \\subseteq}$, and that's why De Morgan's Law holds for both sets and propositional logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "Instead of the propositional formulas themselves, we could also look at their truth values.\n",
    "Show that $\\tuple{ \\setof{F, T}, \\leq }$ with $F \\leq T$ is also a Boolean lattice.\n",
