    "\n",
    "A proposition is a statement that is either true or false.\n",
    "This does not mean that one can necessarily tell whether a proposition is true, nor that the proposition makes any sense considering what our world is like.\n",
    "It just means that the statement is such that it can have a truth value.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "All of the following are propositions, even though whether they're true or false can depend greatly on context:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Nobody likes ponies.</li>\n",
    "<li>He always snores like a pig.</li>\n",
    "<li>$2 + 2 = 4$</li>\n",
    "<li>We might see another stock market crash soon.</li>\n",
    "<li>A language is regular iff it is recognized by a finite-state automaton.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "The following are not propositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Are you mad?</li>\n",
    "<li>Please open a window.</li>\n",
    "<li>Hell, yeah!</li>\n",
    "<li>A cute kitten</li>\n",
    "<li>John and Mary</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Some cases are borderline and require some more detailed analysis.\n",
    "Take *Either John leaves or I will*.\n",
    "As a literal description of how the world is, this can be either true or false, so it's a proposition.\n",
    "But we can also interpret it as a command that the addressee must choose between John and the speaker.\n",
    "Commands have no truth value and thus aren't propositions.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "For each one of the following, say whether it is a proposition.\n",
    "If you say no, justify your answer.\n",

    "<li>John and Peter met yesterday.</li>\n",

    "## Entailment\n",
    "\n",
    "Some propositions are atomic in the sense that one cannot break them down into smaller propositions, whereas others are clearly built up from smaller propositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "The sentence *John rode a bike and Mary her dragon* might be true or false, so it's a proposition.\n",
    "But it is not an atomic proposition because it's built up from two smaller propositions.\n",
    "One is *John rode a bike*, the other one *Mary rode her dragon* (that English allows for the verb to be omitted in the second conjunct is irrelevant for this point).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, propositions can be related to each other so that the truth value of one follows immediately from the other.\n",
    "This is called **entailment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "If *John rode a bike and Mary her dragon* is true, then it must also be true that John rode a bike, and it must be true that Mary rode her dragon.\n",
    "In the other direction, if *John rode a bike* is false, then so is *John rode a bike and Mary her dragon*.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Entailment can also hold between propositions that do not stand in an obvious part-whole relation to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Consider the sentences *If pigs can fly, then Sokrates is a chain-smoking dragon* and *No human is a dragon*.\n",
    "Assuming that both are true, the sentence *Sokrates is human* entails that pigs cannot fly.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The entailments in these two examples are slightly different.\n",
    "For the first, it suffices to recognize how one proposition was built up from smaller ones.\n",
    "The second one presents a more complex reasoning pattern that hinges on the meaning of the quantifier *no*.\n",
    "Logic was devised as a means to study these different kinds of entailments, but over the centuries it has evolved to a highly flexible system that can be used for all kinds of purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "For each one of the following pairs of sentences, say whether entailment holds, and if so, in which direction.\n",
    "If entailment does not hold, explain why.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "John likes his son's sisters. |\n",
    "John likes his daughters.\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "I am 30 years old. |\n",
    "My age is a multiple of 15.\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li>\n",
    "1 is not a prime number. |\n",
    "No prime numbers is less than 2.\n",
    "</li>\n",

    "John and Bill both left the party early. |\n",
