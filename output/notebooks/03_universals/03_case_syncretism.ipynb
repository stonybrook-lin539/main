    "# Monotonicity in case syncretism\n",
    "\n",
    "Monotonicity also seems to play a role in case syncretism.\n",
    "In languages with a morphologically realized case system, some cases may receive the same form in some paradigms.\n",
    "This is shown below for Latin *rex* 'king', where nominative and accusative are syncretic in the plural, as are dative and ablative.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Case | Singular | Plural   | \n",
    "| --:  | :--      | :--      | \n",
    "| Nom  | rex      | reg-es   | \n",
    "| Gen  | reg-is   | reg-um   | \n",
    "| Dat  | reg-i    | reg-ibus | \n",
    "| Acc  | reg-em   | reg-es   | \n",
    "| Abl  | reg-e    | reg-ibus | \n",
    "\n",
    "As with person pronoun paradigms and adjectival gradation, some conceivable case syncretisms never show up in any language. \n",
    "Again we are forced to explain some typological gaps, and again monotonicity provides an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Genitive, Dative and Accusative\n",
    "\n",
    "Case systems can be very complex and convoluted, so we will only focus on a few simple problems here.\n",
    "We will use *Blake's case hierarchy* as our starting point.\n",
    "Slightly truncated, it postulates that\n",
    "$\\text{Nom} <\n",
    "\\text{Acc} <\n",
    "\\text{Gen} <\n",
    "\\text{Dat} <\n",
    "\\text{others}$,\n",
    "where *others* is a placeholder for all other cases.\n",
    "The $^*$ABA generalization can be extended to this hierarchy.\n",
    "In this broader form, it states that two cases $x$ and $z$ cannot have the same form in a paradigm unless every case $y$ that occurs between them in the hierarchy also has this form in the paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "The paradigm for Latin <i>rex</i> displays syncretism of nominative and accusative to the exclusion of genitive, dative, and ablative.\n",
    "But since these cases do not occur between nominative and accusative in Blake's case hierarchy, this obeys the $^*$ABA generalization.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "The paradigm for <i>rex</i> also has syncretism of dative and ablative in the plural.\n",
    "Can a monotonic function produce this pattern from Blake's case hierarchy?\n",
    "Justify your answer.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a problem with the monotonicity account, though.\n",
    "In many Germanic languages, dative and accusative are syncretic to the exclusion of genitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "In German, it is very common for nominative, dative and accusative to take the base form, whereas genitive receives a special affix.\n",
    "So <i>Papa</i> 'dad' could be nominative, dative, or accusative, whereas the genitive must be <i>Papas</i>.\n",
    "German is not an ideal example, though, as the genitive is becoming increasingly unproductive and the dative allows for a special suffix <i>-e</i> for nouns that end in a consonant.\n",
    "The dative of <i>Mann</i> can be either <i>Mann</i> or <i>Manne</i>, although the latter sounds very archaic.\n",
    "Nonetheless, it is conceivable that the dative of <i>Papa</i> is underlyingly <i>Papae</i>, with the final vowel subsequently deleted by some phonological process.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "A better example comes from Icelandic <i>faðir</i> (father).\n",
    "Its dative and accusative are <i>föður</i>, whereas the genitive is <i>föðurs</i>.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Blake's hierarchy in its current form does not allow such patterns without violating monotonicity.\n",
    "Either monotonicity is too restrictive a notion, or Blake's hierarchy is wrong.\n",
    "We could of course try to change the hierarchy, but the easy options do not work.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "Explain why the following hierarchy is empirically inadequate:\n",
    "$\\text{Nom} <\n",
    "\\text{Gen} <\n",
    "\\text{Acc} <\n",
    "\\text{Dat} <\n",
    "\\text{others}$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "Icelandic also has some nouns where nominative and genitive are syncretic to the exclusion of dative and accusative.\n",
    "Which variants of Blake's hierarchy does this rule out?\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Partial orders to the rescue\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that no matter how we order the cases, at least one attested syncretism will violate monotonicity.\n",
    "But perhaps we are accidentally limiting ourselves.\n",
    "So far, we have implicitly assumed that linguistic hierarchies must be total: for any given $x$ and $y$, it holds that $x < y$, or $y < x$, or $x = y$.\n",
    "This is a natural starting point, but it isn't a necessary one.\n",
    "Monotonicity also works if we consider **partial orders**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a partial order, some elements may be unordered with respect to each other.\n",
    "This allows us to make a small but important modification to Blake's hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "![mid](./blake_partialorder.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how genitive and accusative are now unordered with respect to each other.\n",
    "Monotonicity is a restriction on what a function may map some elements $x$ and $y$ that are ordered with respect to each other.\n",
    "But monotonicity has nothing to say for cases where no such ordering holds.\n",
    "If there is no order between $x$ and $y$, then it does not matter whether $f(x) \\leq f(y)$ or the other way round.\n",
    "Without an ordering between accusative and genitive, it becomes possible for accusative and dative to be syncretic to the exclusion of genitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Let $a$, $d$, $g$ be shorthands for accusative, dative, and genitive, respectively.\n",
    "Now suppose that $a$ and $d$ are both mapped to the same exponent, which is different to the realization of genitive: $f(a) = f(d) \\neq f(g)$.\n",
    "This is compatible with the assumption of a monotonically increasing (or decreasing) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "First, the revised case hierarchy above establishes that $a < d$.\n",
    "If $f$ is monotonically increasing, then $a < d$ entails $f(a) \\leq f(d)$.\n",
    "By our initial assumption, $f(a) = f(d)$, which confirms $f(a) \\leq f(d)$.\n",
    "Our revised case hierarchy also postulates that $g < d$, so it must be the case that $f(g) \\leq f(d)$.\n",
    "Whether this holds depends on how one orders the surface forms, but it is always possible to pick an ordering for which this holds.\n",
    "Finally, $a$ and $g$ are unordered with respect to each other, so the relative order of $f(a)$ and $f(g)$ is irrelevant for monotonicity.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "For each one of the following syncretisms, state whether it can be realized by a monotonic mapping assuming the modified Blake hierarchy (if necessary, you may assume a different linear order of output forms for each syncretism).\n",
    "Justify your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Syncretism of nominative and genitive to the exclusion of accusative</li>\n",
    "<li>Syncretism of nominative and dative to the exclusion of accusative</li>\n",

    "It seems, then, that monotonicity does a lot of work even in the richer domain of case syncretisms.\n",
