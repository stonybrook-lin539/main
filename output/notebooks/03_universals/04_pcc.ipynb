    "The difference between these PCCs is how far grammaticality gets to spread in each direction.\n",
    "The top-right corner, however, is the well-formed starting point for all PCC variants.\n",
    "This should be the starting point of our hierarchy, then, and its lowest point should be the bottom-left corner.\n",
    "But the top-right corner corresponds to $\\tuple{1,3}$, whereas our person-person hierarchy starts with $\\tuple{1,1}$.\n",
    "Similarly, our hierarchy bottoms out at $\\tuple{3,3}$, whereas the bottom-left corner of the table is $\\tuple{3,1}$.\n",
    "This suggests a somewhat counterintuitive fix: use the reversed person hierarchy for the second component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an ordering relation $R$, its **inverse** $\\inv{R}$ is the set $\\setof{ \\tuple{b,a} \\mid \\tuple{a,b} \\in R }$.\n",
    "So we literally reverse the order.\n",
    "The reverse of $1 < 2 < 3$ is $3 < 2 < 1$.\n",
    "Let us use $\\prec$ for this reversed order to clearly separate it from $<$.\n",

    "In the pointwise definition, we now use $<$ for the first component and $\\prec$ for the second.\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that the attested types of PCCs can also be viewed as instances of a monotonicity requirement.\n",
    "This is a significant success because the PCC operates at the interface of morphology and syntax.\n",
    "It is very different in nature from the syncretism phenomena we have encountered for morphology.\n",
    "Monotonicity really seems to be interwoven into various subareas of language: morphology ($^*$ABA, syncretism), morphosyntax (PCC), and semantics (NPI-licensing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these are all very different phenomena, and linguists use very different pieces of machinery to model and analyze them.\n",
    "At the usual level of linguistic description, there seems to be no unifying force that ties them all together.\n",
    "But our more abstract, mathematical view can identify monotonicity as the central condition, with variation stemming solely from differences in the structures that monotonicity applies to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The monotonicity account is not perfect, of course.\n",
    "Often there are additional principles that need to be put in place.\n",
    "For instance, adjectival gradation (*good-better-best*) never displays AAB patterns, even though those are monotonic.\n",
    "Similarly, our revised person-person hierarchy allows for a few monotonic mappings that do not correspond to attested PCCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=exercise>\n",
    "Give two examples of functions from the revised person-person hierarchy to <b>2</b> (i.e. the True/False structure) that are monotonic but not one of the four PCCs.\n",
    "You can represent them in the pictorial format used above.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "So monotonicity does not tell the whole story, for each domain there are additional factors to take into consideration.\n",
    "But monotonicity is sufficient to carve out a broad range of options that need to be whittled down a bit by additional restrictions.\n",
    "It is truly remarkable how much linguistic work can be done by such a simple mathematical concept."
