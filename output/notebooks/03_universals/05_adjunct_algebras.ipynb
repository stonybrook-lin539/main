    "\n",
    "The ideas encountered in the previous notebooks can also be applied to syntax to explain a rather odd universal of syntax: the **Adjunct Island Constraint** (AIC).\n",
    "The AIC builds on the long-standing distinction between **arguments** and **adjuncts** and states that the latter are opaque to extraction.\n",
    "For instance, we may move a wh-word out of an argument clause headed by *that*, but not out of an adjunct clause headed by *because*.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Argument**\n",
    "    1. John complained that Mary wants to watch which movie? (good)\n",
    "    1. Which movie did John complain that Mary wants to watch? (good)\n",
    "1.  **Adjunct**\n",
    "    1. John complained because Mary wants to watch which movie? (good)\n",
    "    1. Which movie did John complain because Mary wants to watch? (bad)\n",

    "We will see in a moment what exactly is going on here, and why it may be regarded as yet another monotonicity requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arguments versus adjuncts\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between arguments and adjuncts is well-established.\n",
    "An argument is a phrase that is introduced and required by some other word in the sentence.\n",
    "For example, in *John devoured twelve pounds of pasta yesterday*, both *John* and *twelve pounds of pasta* are arguments of the verb *devour*.\n",
    "Neither one can be easily removed - *devoured twelve pounds of pasta yesterday* is not well-formed, and neither is *John devoured yesterday*.\n",
    "So the arguments of the verb are a necessary part of the sentence.\n",
    "We cannot freely throw in additional arguments, either: *John devoured Mary twelve pounds of pasta yesterday the whole bowl* is not a good sentence of English.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjuncts, on the other hand, are much less tightly controlled than arguments.\n",
    "They can be removed and added without problem.\n",
    "The adverb *yesterday* in *John devoured twelve pounds of pasta yesterday* is an adjunct, and indeed it can be removed without reducing the well-formedess of the string.\n",
    "We can also add additional adverbs, e.g. the adverb *quickly* or the adjective *delicious*.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. John quickly devoured twelve pounds of pasta yesterday.\n",
    "1. John devoured twelve pounds of delicious pasta yesterday.\n",
    "1. John quickly devoured twelve pounds of delicious pasta yesterday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can establish an order between the sentences above based on whether one can be obtained from the other by adding 0 or more adjuncts.\n",
    "Let us denote this relation by $\\leq_A$.\n",
    "Then\n",
    "\n",
    "- *John devoured twelve pounds of pasta* $\\leq_A$ *John (quickly) devoured twelve (delicious) pounds of pasta (yesterday)*,\n",

    "For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that sentences are strings rather than trees.\n",
    "There's a good chance that any syntactician reading this sentence just suffered from an aneurysm.\n",
    "But rest assured, we're not going to brush aside a century of syntactic research.\n",
    "What we are about to discuss works just as well with trees.\n",
    "In fact, using trees instead of strings is the superior perspective and fixes some problems that are glossed over here.\n",
    "But trees make the math a bit more complicated, which is why the general ideas surface more clearly with strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another disclaimer: rather than developing a linguistically informed theory of adjuncts, we will just assume that we are given some fixed $A \\subseteq \\Sigma^*$ of adjunct phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "For English, $A$ would contain\n",
    "<i>quickly</i>,\n",

    "In other words, $t$ can be obtained by adding finitely many adjunct phrases from $A$ to $s$ (this includes adding none at all).\n",

    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, and $a_4$ be the empty string $\\emptystring$.\n",
    "Keep in mind that $\\emptystring \\in A^*$.\n",
    "We set $a_5 = \\text{always swiftly}$, which is also a member of $A^*$.\n",
    "Then the concatenation $a_1 \\tuplecat s_1 \\tuplecat a_2 \\tuplecat s_2 \\tuplecat a_3 \\tuplecat s_3 \\tuplecat a_4 \\tuplecat s_4 \\tuplecat a_5$ is *John finishes his homework always swiftly*.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of $\\leq_A$ makes it clear that the relation is transitive.\n",
    "Reflexivity holds because each $a_i$ may be $\\emptystring$.\n",
    "Finally, $\\leq_A$ is antisymmetric because the only case where $s \\leq_A t$ and $t \\leq_A s$ is when $s = t$.\n",
    "So $\\leq_A$ is transitive, reflexive, and antisymmetric, which makes it a weak partial order.\n",

    "Usually, a string language is just a \"flat\" set of strings.\n",
    "But once we fix a set of $A$ of adjuncts, we can order the strings by $\\leq_A$.\n",
    "This turns a string language from a set $L$ into a partially ordered set, or simply **poset**, $\\tuple{L, \\leq_A}$.\n",

    "We will not be able to completely solve the mystery, but we can add an intriguing new perspective to the mix.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know by now, well-formedness is monotonic over adjunct extension structures.\n",

    "Let us try this with the ill-formed *the supervisor, John invited Mary without telling*.\n",
    "This is an adjunct extension of *the dinner, John invited Mary* (we cannot treat *the dinner without preparing* as a discontinuous adjunct phrase because each adjunct must form a substring).\n",
    "But *the dinner, John invited Mary* is not a well-formed sentence of English.\n",
    "Due to how ungrammaticality travels upward, the ungrammaticality of *the dinner, John invited Mary* necessarily entails that *the dinner, John invited Mary without preparing* is not well-formed either.\n",
    "Hence the adjunct island constraint follows immediately from the monotonicity of well-formedness over adjunct extension structures, which is a consequence of adjuncts being optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of a sudden, the adjunct island constraint is no longer an odd quirk of language but rather the inevitable result of adjuncts being optional and monotonicity playing a major role in linguistic mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is also another thing we expect to see: if removing the adjunct still yields a well-formed sentence, then the adjunct island constraint does not necessarily apply anymore.\n",
    "That's because the AIC is due to ungrammaticality traveling upward, but in the described case the relevant sentence isn't ungrammatical.\n",
    "This is exactly what we find in English with so-called *parasitic gaps*.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This book, John reviewed without reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here it seems like the phrase *this book* was originally both the object of the verb *review* and the gerund *reading* inside the adjunct *without reading*.\n",
    "Such parasitic gap constructions are allowed in English, but not in certain other languages like German.\n",
    "This is pretty much what we expect in our system.\n",
    "Removing the adjunct phrase *without reading* leaves the sentence *this book, John reviewed*, which is well-formed.\n",
    "Since the well-formedness of $s$ does not tell us anything about the well-formedness of any adjunct extension $t$ of $s$, $t$ may be well-formed or not, it depends on the language at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, we have subsumed yet another phenomenon under the umbrella of a monotonicity requirement over linguistic structures.\n",
    "In fact, two phenomena have been captured: monotonicity rigorously enforces the AIC, but it still allows languages to exempt certain constructions such as adjuncts with parasitic gaps."
