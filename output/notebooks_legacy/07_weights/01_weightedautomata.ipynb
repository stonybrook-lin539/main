    "\n",
    "Before we talk about weighted automata, let us look at the familiar FSAs from a slightly different perspective.\n",
    "Consider the FSA below, which produces strings of the form $(\\String{ab})^*$, i.e. $\\emptystring$, $\\String{ab}$, $\\String{abab}$, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "![med](abplus_standard.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The edge from $p$ to $q$ tells us that we can move from $0$ to $1$ when we see an $a$.\n",
    "And then we can move from $q$ to $p$ upon seeing a $b$.\n",
    "However, we cannot move from $p$ to $q$ when we see a $b$, nor can we move from $q$ to $p$ when we see an $a$.\n",
    "It is also impossible to ever move from $p$ to $p$ or from $q$ to $q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we use $1$ as a shorthand for *Yes, you can go here* and $0$ for *No, you cannot pass*.\n",
    "Then we could represent the FSA in a slightly more verbose fashion as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![med](abplus_weighted.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The FSA is almost exactly the same as the previous one, except that every edge also has a *weight* of $1$ attached to it.\n",
    "This provides a new way of calculating whether a string is well-formed.\n",
    "Given a string $s$, we look at the transitions for $s$ through the automaton and multiply all the weights encountered along this path.\n",
    "If there is no transition, we assume a transition with a weight of $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Consider the string $\\String{abab}$, which is recognized by the automaton above.\n",
    "The transitions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\tuple{p,a:1,q}$\n",
    "1. $\\tuple{q,b:1,p}$\n",
    "1. $\\tuple{p,a:1,q}$\n",
    "1. $\\tuple{q,b:1,p}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying out the weights, we get $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n",
    "Interpeting a total weight of $1$ as an indicator that the string is well-formed, we get that $\\String{abab}$ is accepted by the automaton.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $\\String{aba}$, on the other hand, we cannot find a sequence of transitions that evaluates to $1$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "![med](abplus_weighted_verbose.svg)\n",
    "The FSA has an edge for every possible transition in the automaton, but each edge also has a *weight* attached to it, in this case $0$ or $1$."
