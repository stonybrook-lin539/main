    "# Adding Weights to Grammars\n",

    "## Shades of Gray in Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Local grammars and finite-state automata (FSAs) are devices that can tell us for a given string whether it is well-formed or not.\n",
    "This allows us to use them formal model of a speaker's knowledge of their language - a mechanism that can tell us whether certain strings are grammatical or not.\n",
    "But sometimes we are dealing with issues that aren't quite as black and white.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, whether a sentence is grammatical is a very different question from whether it is comprehensible.\n",
    "Garden path sentences are well-formed utterances of English that most speakers cannot recognize as well-formed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The horse raced past the barn fell.\n",
    "1. The old man the boat.\n",
    "1. The cotton clothes are made of grow in Mississippi.\n",
    "1. Until the police arrest the drug dealers are free to roam the streets.\n",
    "\n",
    "These sentences are equivalent to the following, which are much easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The horse that was raced past the barn fell.\n",
    "1. The old people man the boat.\n",
    "1. The cotton that clothes are made of grow in Mississippi.\n",
    "1. Until the police arrest, the drug dealers are free to roam the streets.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the first four sentences above are difficult to understand, there is a certain gradation.\n",
    "Barely any native speaker can figure out the meaning of *the horse raced past the barn fell* without some hints, whereas *the old man the boat* is rather easy in comparison.\n",
    "So we don't have a simple split between comprehensible and incomprehensible, but a scale of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar patter emerges with center embedding constructions, which get increasingly difficult to understand even though they obey the rules of English grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The cheese that the mouse that the cat that the dog barked at chased ate was delicious.\n",
    "1. The cheese that the mouse that the cat chased ate was delicious.\n",
    "1. The cheese that the mouse ate was delicious.\n",
    "1. The cheese was delicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "And this isn't just a property of sentences, we find something similar with sounds, too.\n",
    "There it isn't so much comprehensibility but rather productivity.\n",
    "Many rules for English sound structure are fluid, people do not obey them all the time.\n",
    "Many US-American dialects of English, for instance, have a process known as *intervocalic flapping* which \"softens\" some consonants between vowels.\n",
    "Hence an American may pronounce *butter* similar to *budder*.\n",
    "But this does not always happen.\n",
    "When linguists talk about Sanskrit, they may discuss a process known as *nati* - and most linguists, including Americans, will say *nati* rather than *nadi*.\n",
    "Flapping is also very rare with *military*, whereas it is very common with *capital*.\n",
    "So the process of flapping is not a hard black-and-white rule, flapping is more likely in some words than in others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Devices that only have black-and-white distinctions cannot model this behavior.\n",
    "But it is actually very easy to add shades of grey to them without changing their core behavior, turning them into *weighted grammars* and *weighted automata*.\n",
    "Instead of *well-formed* and *ill-formed*, these weighted devices have a range of values to choose from and provide a mechanism for computing the total value of a string based on the values of its parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From SL Grammars to Weighted Grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we talk about weighted grammars and automata, let us recall how local grammars were made probabilistic.\n",
    "Remember that a strictly $k$-local grammar is a finite set of $k$-grams.\n",
    "Originally we said that the grammar lists forbidden $k$-grams, such that a string is ill-formed iff it contains at least one of those $k$-grams.\n",
    "This is a *negative* grammar.\n",
    "But we can just as well work with *positive* grammars, where a string is well-formed iff it only contains $k$-grams listed in the grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Consider the SL-$2$ grammar $G \\is \\setof{\\LeftEdge a, \\String{ab}, \\String{ba}, b \\RightEdge}$.\n",
    "When interpreted as a negative grammar with alphabet $\\setof{a,b}$, it only licenses the empty string $\\emptystring$.\n",
    "Any other string over $\\setof{a,b}$ contains at least one offending bigram:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>$\\String{a}$ violates $\\LeftEdge a$,</li>\n",
    "<li>$\\String{b}$ violates $b \\RightEdge$,</li>\n",
    "<li>$\\String{aa}$ violates $\\LeftEdge a$,</li>\n",
    "<li>$\\String{ba}$ violates $\\String{ba}$,</li>\n",
    "<li>$\\String{bb}$ violates $b \\RightEdge$,</li>\n",
    "<li>and so on.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as a positive grammar it generates $(\\String{ab})^+$, i.e. $\\String{ab}$, $\\String{abab}$, $\\String{ababab}$, and so forth.\n",
    "Among the illicit strings we find\n",
    "\n",

    "<li>and so on.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",

    "For every positive grammar, we can calculate the well-formedness of a string with an arithmetic formula.\n",

    "From $M$, we build the formula\n",

    "From this view, it is a trivial step to make an SL-grammar probabilistic: instead of mapping every $k$-gram to either $0$ or $1$, we allow ourselves values in between such as $0.5$ or $0.3582107$.\n",
    "The values can also be multiplied, giving us a total probability value for a string based on the probabilities of the $k$-grams it is built from.\n",
    "This is a special instance of *weighting* a grammar, which means to allow more than just two values.\n",
    "Probabilities are a common choice for weights because they can be derived from frequencies in corpus data, and because multiplications works the same way for them as for the *Boolean weights* $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But one can have weights without going all the way to a probabilistic grammar.\n",
    "For example, we could choose our weights to be $0$, $1$ and $2$ instead, where $0$ means *ill-formed*, $1$ is *slightly deviant*, and $2$ is *well-formed*.\n",
    "Or we could just have the special symbols $\\diamondsuit$, $\\clubsuit$, and $\\spadesuit$.\n",

    "We could define it for sure, but how do we know that the result will behave in a reasonable manner?\n",
    "In order to answer these questions, we have to delve a bit into a subbranch of mathematics known as *abstract algebra*.\n",

    "\n",
    "When the average person hears the word *algebra*, they think of things like quadratic equations.\n",

    "It is the study of algebraic structures, which are sets with certain operations defined over them.\n",
    "For example, the set of natural numbers with addition is an algebraic structure, and so is $\\Sigma^*$ with string concatenation.\n",
    "But one step at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we are looking at abstract algebra now is because it provides a way to identify operations that behave similarly. \n",
    "This will allow us to generalize multiplication to arbitrary sets of weights, greatly expanding our ability to define weighted grammars with whatever weights we deem appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a starting point, we should identify the core properties of multiplication that we want to preserve.\n",
    "We consider both the Boolean case where our only values are $0$ and $1$, and the probabilistic case with arbitrary real numbers between $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "We denote the former class of weights by $\\setof{0,1}$ and the latter by $[0,1]$.\n",
    "The first thing to notice is that both $\\setof{0,1}$ and $[0,1]$ are closed under multiplication.\n",
    "No matter whether take the domain of multiplication to be $\\setof{0,1} \\times \\setof{0,1}$ or $[0,1] \\times [0,1]$, the result of multiplication is also a member of the domain.\n",
    "For instance, $1 \\times 0 = 0$, which is in the domain $\\setof{0,1}$, and $0.3 \\times 0.766 = 0.2298$, which is in the domain $[0,1]$.\n",

    "The structure $\\tuple{\\mathbb{N}, -}$, on the other hand, is not a semigroup even if we require subtraction to never drop below $0$.\n",

    "For example, the function that maps every string to the set of $k$-grams that occur in said string can be viewed as a weighted grammar.\n",
    "How so?\n",
    "Consider a weighted grammar that operates with the algebraic structure $\\tuple{\\wp(\\Sigma^k), \\cup}$.\n",
    "This is a monoid: $\\wp(\\Sigma^k)$ is closed under union, union is associative, and for every set $S$ it holds that $S \\cup \\emptyset = S$, so that $\\emptyset \\in \\wp(\\Sigma^k)$ is an identity element for $\\cup$.\n",
    "Now suppose that the grammar contains every $k$-gram $g \\in \\Sigma^k$ and assigns it the weight $\\setof{g}$.\n",
    "Using our standard formula, the total value of the string according to this grammar is the set of all its $k$-grams.\n",
