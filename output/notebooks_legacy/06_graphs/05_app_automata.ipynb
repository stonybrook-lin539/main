    "Since our definition of graphs only allows for at most one edge between two states, cases with several symbols must be handled by tying all those symbols to that edge.\n",

    "Given two FSAs $A$ and $B$ that recognize the languages $L(A)$ and $L(B)$, respectively, one can construct an automaton $A \\cap B$ that recognizes $L(A) \\cap L(B)$.\n",
    "This shows that the class of regular languages are closed under intersection.\n",

    "\n",
    "The construction of $A \\cap B$ is actually fairly simple as it all amounts to constructing an automaton that runs $A$ and $B$ in parallel.\n",
    "But one thing after another:\n",
    "intuitively, a string $s$ is in the intersection of $L(A)$ and $L(B)$ only if there is an accepting run of $A$ over $s$ and an accepting run of $B$ over $s$.\n",
    "So if we were to run $A$ and $B$ in parallel, both would have to end up in a final state.\n",

    "So $abaa$ would be recognized by both and thus in the intersection of $L(A)$ and $L(B)$, whereas $a$ would be rejected by $B$ and $abab$ would be rejected by $A$.\n",

    "After the next $a$ your finger moves from $2$ to $0$ in $A$, and from $2$ to $3$ in $B$.\n",
    "Finally, the last $a$ shifts you from $0$ to $1$ in $A$, and from $3$ to $0$ in $B$.\n",
    "Both are final states, and thus the string is recognized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this intuiton, we construct an automaton where each state keeps track of the position of our fingers in these two automata.\n",
    "For the string above, we start out in $0,0$ and move to $1,1$ with an $a$ transition.\n",
    "After that a $b$ transition moves us to $2,2$, from which another $a$ gets us to $0,3$, and from there to $1,0$.\n",
    "For any two states $a,x$ and $b,y$, there is a $\\sigma$-transition from $a,x$ to $b,y$ iff there is a $\\sigma$-transition from $a$ to $b$ and in the first automaton and a $\\sigma$-transition from $x$ to $y$ in the second automaton. \n",

    "That is truly awful, with $m = 4$ and a short string of length $5$ this may already require $4^5 = (2^2)^5 = 2^10 = 1024$ steps instead of just $5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to this kind of serial search is to do parallel search: whenever we reach a state with $m$ choices, we make $m$ copies of the automaton and each copy proceeds along of the possible paths.\n",
    "Now recognition can again proceed in real-time (modulo the cost of spawning copies of the automaton), but we consume a lot of memory.\n",
    "This situation is very common in software engineering, and it is known as a time-space tradeoff: either we do it slow but memory-efficient, or we do it fast but at a much higher memory cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The copy-spawning idea can be compiled directly into a non-deterministic automaton by *determinizing* it.\n",
    "The idea isn't too dissimilar from the construction of the intersection automaton: each state consists of multiple components that encode the state of one of the spawned copies.\n",
    "The construction is slightly more efficient though.\n",
    "If one represents the state configuration of $m$ copies by a member of $Q^m$, then there is a risk that one ends up with many redundant states.\n",
    "For example, the states $\\tuple{q,u,q}$ and $\\tuple{q,q,u}$ encode the same information: one copy is in state $u$, the other two in state $q$.\n",
