    "# Multisets for Local Grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only the bag-of-words model becomes much more versatile once one moves from sets to multisets, the same holds for SL and TSL grammars.\n",
    "As you hopefully recall, these grammars deem a string well-formed or ill-formed based on whether it contains any forbidden $n$-grams.\n",
    "This is expressed mathematically by mapping a string to its **set** of $n$-grams, and the intersecting this set with the grammar.\n",
    "The string is well-formed iff the intersection is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously we could also map a string to the **multiset** of all its $n$-grams, that's exactly what the bag-of-words model does.\n",
    "That said, many things can be done with math, the question is whether it is worth doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding Weights to Local Grammars\n",
    "\n",

    "A *weighted local grammar* can account for such variation.\n",
    "In such a grammar, each $n$-gram has a *weight* that expresses its relative importance.\n",
    "In principle we can pick our weights as we see fit: natural numbers, integers, thumbs up/middle/down, the grades A, B, C, D, F, and so on.\n",
    "Anything is game as long as there is a clear ordering between the individual weights.\n",
    "Usually, though, one uses probabilities for the weights because they can be equated with relative frequencies, which in turn can be computed automatically from texts.\n",
    "So in most cases a weighted local grammar is one where each $n$-gram has a certain probability value attached to it.\n",
    "To calculate the probability of a string according to the grammar, one simply multiplies the probability values of all $n$-gram tokens in the string.\n",
