    "<div class=definition>\n",
    "    Let $A$ and $B$ be arbitrary sets.\n",
    "    Then $A$ is a *subset* of $B$ ($A \\subseteq B$) iff every member of $A$ is a member of $B$.\n",
    "    In this case, $B$ is a *superset* of $A$ ($B \\supseteq A$).\n",

    "    A transitive verb is a verb that occurs with a subject and an object: *devour*, *contradict*, *wager*, *flummox*, and many more.\n",
    "    Not all verbs are transitive, e.g. *sleep* or *give*. \n",
    "    Suppse $T$ is the set of all English transitive verbs, whereas $V$ is the set of all English verbs.\n",
    "    Since every transitive verb is a verb, but no the other way round, we have $T \\subseteq V$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=definition>\n",
    "    For $A$ and $B$ arbitrary sets, $A$ is a *proper subset* of $B$ ($A \\subsetneq B$) iff $A \\subseteq B$ and there is a $b \\in B$ such that $b \\notin A$.\n",

    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "    Given our previous discussion, it is clear that the set $T$ of transitive verbs is proper subset of the set $V$ of verbs.\n",

    "If there are two sets $A$ and $B$ such that neither $A \\subseteq B$ nor $B \\subseteq A$, then there can be only two scenarios.\n",
    "One option is that $A$ and $B$ are *disjoint*, which means that there is no $x$ such that both $x \\in A$ and $x \\in B$ - the two sets have absolutely no overlap.\n",
    "Or $A$ and $B$ might be *incomparable*.\n",
    "In this case the two sets have a limited overlap such that there is at least one $x$ with both $x \\in A$ and $x \\in B$, but there are also $a \\in A$ and $b \\in B$ such that $a \\notin B$ and $b \\notin A$.\n",

    "    Many words like *water*, *cut*, *fall*, *love*, *try*, *judge*, *beat*, or *cross* can be used as nouns or verbs, but many other words are used only as nouns (*tree*, *waterfall*, *idea*, *Ferrari*) or only as verbs (*write*, *convince*, *admonish*, *clean*).\n",

    "## The Powerset\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is useful to take a set and consider all sets one could build from its elements.\n",
    "For example, each one of the following sets can be built form the elements of $\\setof{1,2,3}$: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\emptyset$\n",
    "1. $\\setof{1}$\n",
    "1. $\\setof{2}$\n",
    "1. $\\setof{3}$\n",
    "1. $\\setof{1,2}$\n",
    "1. $\\setof{1,3}$\n",
    "1. $\\setof{2,3}$\n",
    "1. $\\setof{1,2,3}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each one of the sets in this list is a subset of $\\setof{1,2,3}$, and every subset of $\\setof{1,2,3}$ is on this list.\n",
    "So the above is the list of all subsets of $\\setof{1,2,3}$.\n",
    "The set of all these sets is called the *powerset* of $\\setof{1,2,3}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=definition>\n",
    "    For $A$ a set, the *powerset* of $A$ is $\\wp(A) \\is \\setof{ S \\mid S \\subseteq A }$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many alternative notations for the powerset.\n",
    "A particularly common one is $2^A$ as it highlights two interesting aspects of the powerset.\n",
    "First, we define the *cardinality* of a set $A$ as the number of elements it contains, and we denote it by $\\card{A}$.\n",
    "For example, $\\card{\\setof{1,2,3}} = 3$.\n",
    "Now we can state a universal truth for the cardinality of powersets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=theorem>\n",
    "    For every set $A$ with $\\card{A} = n$, it holds that $\\card{\\wp(A)} = \\card{2^A} = 2^\\card{A} = 2^n$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is witnessed by our example set $\\setof{1,2,3}$, the powerset of which has $8$ members (see the list above).\n",
    "Feel free to compute the powerset of $\\setof{1,2}$ and $\\setof{1,2,3,4}$, you will see that they have $4$ and $16$ members, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the $2^A$ notation for powersets has a deeper meaning that goes beyond mere numbers.\n",
    "The notation $B^A$ is sometimes used to represent the set of all functions from $A$ to $B$.\n",
    "And $2$ can be construed not just as the number $2$, but as any set with cardinality $2$, including $\\setof{\\top, \\bot}$.\n",
    "So $2^A$ can be taken to denote the set of all functions from $A$ to $\\setof{\\top, \\bot}$.\n",
    "But since functions are sets, this is exactly the class of all subsets of $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In sum, the $2^A$ notation for powersets is very pleasing on a theoretical level.\n",
    "But humans are a practical bunch, and since superscripts are slightly strenuous to read, $\\wp(A)$ is the preferred notation for powersets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Union, Intersection, and Complement\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=definition>\n",
    "    Let $A$ and $B$ be arbitrary sets.\n",
    "    <ol>\n",
    "    <li>The *union* of $A$ and $B$ is $A \\cup B \\is \\setof{ x \\mid x \\in A \\text{ or } x \\in B}$.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The *intersection* of $A$ and $B$ is $A \\cap B \\is \\setof{ x \\mid x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\in B}$.</li>\n",
    "    <li>The *relative complement* of $A$ and $B$ is $A - B \\is \\setof{ x \\mid x \\in A \\text{ and } x \\notin B}$.</li>\n",
    "    <li>If $A$ is clear from context, we just write $\\overline{B}$ for $A - B$ and call it the *complement* of $B$.</li>\n",
    "    </ol>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that order does not matter for union and intersection: $A \\cup B = B \\cup A$, and $A \\cap B = B \\cap A$.\n",
    "But in general $A - B \\neq B - A$."
