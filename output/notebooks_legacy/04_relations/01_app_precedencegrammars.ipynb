    "We have previously encountered two types of local grammars.\n",
    "A strictly $k$-local (SL-$k$) grammar extracts all $k$-grams from a string and compares that against the $k$-grams listed in the grammar.\n",
    "A tier-based strictly $k$-local (TSL-$k$) grammar also has a fixed set $S$ of symbols that are all removed from the string before $k$-grams are extracted.\n",
    "But in both cases the grammars look at contiguous subparts of a specific string when they extract the $k$-grams.\n",
    "In other words, they are extracting *substrings*.\n",

    "For example, *John likes Mary* is the result of $\\tuple{\\text{John likes Mary}} \\tuplecat \\emptystring$, so $\\emptystring$ is a part of this string.\n",

    "If we visualize the natural numbers as an infinite string that starts at $0$ and then expands without bounds to the right, each application of the successor function takes us one step farther to the right along this string.\n",
    "Since strings are a mapping from an initial subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ to $\\Sigma$, we can also use $\\succ$ to take a step to the right through a string.\n",
    "In *undo*, $\\succ(1) = 2$ would amount to taking us from *n* to *d*.\n",
    "Often it is convenient to use symbols rather than numbers in this case, so that we could write $\\succ(\\text{n}) = \\text{d}$ for the case above.\n",
    "But this requires that is clear from context which position of the string we have in mind; in *undocumented* $\\succ(\\text{n})$ could refer to two very different positions with distinct successors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The connection between substrings and successors is that substrings encode a claim about outputs for the successor function.\n",
