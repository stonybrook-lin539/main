    "\n",
    "So far we have treated sentences as strings, as simple sequences of words.\n",
    "But decades of syntactic research have amassed an enormous body of evidence that this simply isn't the right way of thinking about sentences.\n",
    "Some words in a sentence are more tightly connected than others, and a string cannot encode this fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "The sentence *John saw the man with the telescope* can have two meanings: one where John used a telescope to see the man, and one where the man that John saw had a telescope with him.\n",
    "In the first case *with the telescope* seems more closely connected to *saw*, in the second to *man*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example comes from the possibility in English to emphasize parts of a sentence by putting them at the beginning, as in the following paradigm:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>The old man met this girl at a party</li>\n",
    "<li>It is the old man that met this girl at a party</li>\n",
    "<li>It is this girl that the old man met at a party</li>\n",
    "<li>It is at a party that the old man met this girl</li>\n",
    "<li>It is a party that the old man met this girl at</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "But not everything can go in this spot, even if could be worth emphasizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>It is man (not woman) that the old met this girl at a party</li>\n",
    "<li>It is old (not young) that the man met this girl at a party</li>\n",

    "<li>It is met (not kiss) that the old man this girl at a party</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "So not all words in a sentence are on the same level, some can do things that other cannot.\n",
    "And the same argument also shows that not all substrings of a sentence are alike.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of flat strings, trees are more like chemical molecules where words are connected by intricate structures.\n",
    "Linguists formalize these structures by *trees*, such as the one below.\n",

    "\n",
    "As in all sciences, there isn't perfect agreement about how to analyze the facts, and so you might also find other tree structures being proposed.\n",

    "There certainly are many differences between these structures, but the motivation for these differences would be the subject of a syntax class.\n",
    "We are only concerned with the mathematical status of these structures.\n",
    "And here things are simple: despite all their differences, all these structures are trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree consists of a number of nodes that are ordered vertically.\n",
    "The tree must have a single node at the very top, which is called its *root*.\n",
    "Each node may have one or more branches that connect it to nodes below it.\n",
    "Crucially, no node can be connected to more than one node above it.\n",
    "That's what gives the tree-like appearance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Trees as Labeled Gorn Tree Domains\n",
    "\n",
    "Since trees are a fundamental data structure in linguistics, we will be dealing with them quite a bit at various points.\n",
    "That's why we need to have a precise terminology to talk about them, and a more abstract understanding for what a tree is (among other things, this is very useful if you ever have to write a program that works with trees rather than strings).\n",
    "The most common view of trees defines them as a special type of graph.\n",
    "But we haven't encountered graphs yet, and to be honest, the definition is rather clunky.\n",
    "Instead, we will take an approach that reveals trees to be a natural generalization of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that each string is a function from an initial subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ to some fixed set $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "Here's another way of saying that: each string is a pair $\\tuple{D, \\ell}$ where $D$ is a *downward-closed* set of natural numbers and $\\ell$ is a *labeling function* from $D$ to $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "By downward-closed we mean that for every $y \\in D$ and $x < y$, it must be the case that $y \\in D$.\n",
    "So $4 \\in D$ implies $3 \\in D$, $2 \\in D$, $1 \\in D$, and $0 \\in D$.\n",
    "This definition of string is fully equivalent with our original one, but it makes it clearer what the work of a string function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It has to pick out a set of nodes, which can be linearly ordered by $<$ without any gaps.\n",
    "2. It must give each one of those nodes a label, drawn from $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now think about how a tree differs from a string.\n",
    "We still have a set of nodes, as for strings, and we still have to give every node a label.\n",
    "The only thing that has become more complicated is the arrangement between the nodes, which is no longer a simple line but can contain forks at any given point.\n",
    "This is the only complexity that trees add over strings.\n",
    "In a string, we can look at node $2$ and know immediately that it occurs to the right of $1$ and $0$.\n",
    "What we would like for trees is a similar system of numbering nodes that immediately allows us to infer which nodes are above the one we picked.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to that are *Gorn addresses*.\n",
    "This is a simple system that assigns each node in a tree a unique identifier that is not a number, but a string of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Let's look once more at the very frist tree we encountered in this unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "![mid](./tree_psg.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead of the labels we write down the Gorn addresses of each node, the tree looks as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "![mid](./tree_psg_gorn.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "A Gorn address of node $n$ is the result of concatenating two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Gorn address of the node $m$ immediately above $n$.\n",
    "1. The number of nodes that are to the left of $n$ that also have $m$ immediately above them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "The root node always has the address $\\emptystring$ by convention.\n",
    "The nodes below the root are $0$ and $1$.\n",
    "Since the address of the node above them is $\\emptystring$, that is their first component.\n",
    "The first node has no other nodes ot its left, so its second component is 0, and $\\emptystring \\tuplecat 0 = 0$.\n",
    "The second node has one node to its left, so we have $\\emptystring \\tuplecat 1 = 1$.\n",
    "Below $1$ we find two nodes, whose addresses are $10$ and $11$.\n",
    "Careful here: those aren't the natural numbers ten and eleven, those are the strings $1 \\tuplecat 0 = 10$ and $1 \\tuplecat 1 = 11$.\n",
    "So they should be read \"one-zero\" and \"one-one\".\n",
    "Similarly, $1110$ is not \"one thousand one hundred ten\", or \"one hundred eleven - zero\", it is \"one-one-one-zero\".\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Gorn addresses follow a very specific pattern, the set of Gorn addresses for any given tree obeys two closure properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prefix closure:** if string $a$ is an address for a node in the tree, then so is every prefix of $a$\n",
    "1. **Downward closure:** if string $a$ is an address for a node in the tree,\n",
    "then so is every string that can be obtained from $a$ by replacing the last symbol by a smaller natural number.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Consider once more our example tree, repeated here for your convenience:\n",
    "\n",
    "![mid](./tree_psg_gorn.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pick any arbitrary node, say, $111$.\n",
    "The prefixes of $111$ are, in decreasing length: $111$, $11$, $1$, and $\\emptystring$.\n",
    "Every one of those addresses is part of the tree - they're the addresses of the nodes that are higher than $111$.\n",
    "And we can also take $111$ and replace its last component by the smaller number $0$ to get $110$.\n",
    "That's the address to the left of $111$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "With Gorn addresses, is it very easy to define trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=definition>\n",
    "A *$\\Sigma$-labeled Gorn tree domain* (or simply *$\\Sigma$-tree*) is a pair $\\tuple{D, \\ell}$, where $D \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}^*$ is the set of nodes in the tree and  $\\ell: D \\rightarrow \\Sigma$ is a (total) labeling function.\n",
    "We require that $D$ satisfies the following closure properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>**Prefix closure:** If $u \\in D$, then $v \\in D$ for every $v$ such that $u = v \\tuplecat v'$ ($v, v' \\in \\mathbb{N}^*$).</li>\n",

    "</ol>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the definition of $\\Sigma$-tree is very similar to the factorized definition of string we used above.\n",
    "The main difference is the choice of $D$.\n",
    "For strings, $D$ is a set of natural numbers, whereas for trees $D$ is a set of strings over natural numbers.\n",
    "In fact, we can view strings just a special case of Gorn tree domains.\n",
    "Suppose that instead of $0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$ we write $\\emptystring, 0, 00, 000, \\ldots$.\n",
    "So the natural numbers are just a shorthand for indicating the length of a string in $\\setof{0}^*$.\n",
    "Then every string has a domain $D \\subseteq \\setof{0}^*$ that is both prefix-closed and downward-closed.\n",
    "In other words, every string satisfies the conditions for being a Gorn tree domain, and thus it is also a tree.\n",

    "## Tree Relations as Relations over Gorn Domains\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us look at several relations over trees and try to define them in formal terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our basic relation is *mother-of*, or to use a more gender-agnostic terms, *parent-of*.\n",
    "Visually, a node $x$ is the mother of $y$ iff $x$ and $y$ are connected by a line and $x$ is higher than $y$.\n",
    "In the other direction, we say that $y$ is a *daughter* or *child* of $x$.\n",
    "So the daughter-of relation is the inverse of the mother-of relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Here is the by now familiar example tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "![mid](./tree_psg.svg)\n",

    "\n",
    "![mid](./tree_psg_gorn.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The node at address $10$ labeled VP is the parent of V and NP at address $100$ and $101$, respectively.\n",
    "This VP node is the daughter of node the node at address $1$, which is also labeled VP.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"node above you\" analogy is not a formal definition of course, it's just a convention for how we draw those trees.\n",
    "If we were to rotate every tree by 90 degrees in counterclockwise fashion, then the parent would instead be to the left.\n",
    "In order to make the parent-of relation more precise, we once again view trees as specific sets of Gorn addresses.\n",
    "As mentioned before, whenever a node $y$ is the daughter of a node $x$, the Gorn address of $y$ is obtained by taking the Gorn address of $x$ and adding a natural number at the end.\n",
    "In other words, $x$ is the mother of $y$ iff $x$ is the longest proper prefix of $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=definition>\n",
    "    Let $D$ be a Gorn tree domain.\n",
    "    Then the *parent-of* relation $P \\subset D \\times D$ contains $\\tuple{x,y}$ iff there exists some $u \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $y = x \\tuplecat u$.\n",
    "    We call $\\inv{P}$ the *child-of* relation.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "In the previous example, we saw that $10$ is the mother of $100$ and $101$.\n",

    "Ordered trees are also easier to study from a mathematical perspective.\n",
    "Finally, the definition of Gorn domains shows that there is already an intrinsic ordering in trees due to how the addresses are chosen.\n",
    "Adding the precedence relation on top of this only makes this fully explicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to be clear, there is nothing wrong with syntacticians claiming that precedence plays no role in how languages actually work.\n",
    "That is an empirical issue and may well be true.\n",
    "But the leap from this empirical claim to the dogma that syntactic trees must not be ordered is not justified.\n",
    "A data structure can have internal order without that order being exploitable for any meaningful purpose.\n",
    "For example, suppose that we require that if some tree is well-formed, then so are all the trees we can build from it by switching the order of siblings.\n",
    "Or if you prefer mathematical jargon, we require the set of well-formed trees to be closed under sibling permutation.\n",
    "Then linear order of trees is useless:\n",
    "Suppose that tree $t$ is ill-formed because it violates some precedence requirement $P$.\n",
    "Then some permutation $u$ of $t$ must satisfy $P$, which means that $u$ is well-formed.\n",
    "But by assumption this implies that every permutation of $u$ is also well-formed, including our original $t$.\n",
    "This contradicts the initial claim that $t$ is ill-formed, which shows that there can be no such precedence requirement $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you allow all possible orders, you can still have ordered trees without being able to discriminate between trees based on their precedence relations.\n",
    "This makes it possible for linguists to have their cake and eat it too: we get a computationally and mathematically better behaved data structure without running into the question why precedence does not seem to matter much in syntax (according to at least some syntacticians, that is).\n",

    "## C-Command\n",
    "\n",
    "C-command has been the most important relation in syntax for many decades.\n",
    "It's importance has decreased somewhat in recent years, but it is still noteworthy for being a genuinely linguistic notion.\n",
    "Whereas the relations we discussed so far are also useful in computer science, c-command is a purely linguistic notion.\n",
    "Intuitively, a node c-commands everything its sisters reflexively dominate.\n",
    "If a node has no sisters, than it c-commands whatever its mother c-commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "You know the deal, let's look at the example tree for the gazillionth time:\n",
    "\n",
    "![mid](./tree_psg_gorn.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $01$ c-commands everything its siblings $00$ and $02$ reflexively dominate.\n",
    "That's $00$, $000$, $02$, and $020$.\n",
    "The node $010$ has no siblings, so it c-commands whatever its parent c-commands.\n",
    "The parent of $010$ is $01$, for which we have already computed th c-commandees.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many definitions of c-command can be found in the literature, and unfortunately many of them are stated in a sloppy manner.\n",
    "Here is a common version: *X c-commands Y iff X does not dominate Y and the first branching node dominating X dominates Y*.\n",
    "Can you find all the things that are wrong with this definition?\n",
    "Think about it for a minute before you read on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, here's the problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What kind of dominance are we talking about?\n",
    "   Proper dominance, reflexive dominance, or possibly even immediate dominance?\n",
    "   The answer is: sometimes proper dominance, sometimes reflexive dominance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is \"the first branching node dominating X\"?\n",
    "   The lowest branching node or the highest branching node?\n",
    "   Or something completely different?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are X and Y?\n",
    "   Presumably nodes, but we can only infer that because dominance is only defined for nodes, not parts of trees or sets of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more exact version of the definition above reads as follows: *X c-commands Y iff X does not reflexively dominate Y and the lowest branching node properly dominating X also properly dominates Y.*\n",
    "This is still not perfect because we the meaning of lowest has to be intuited, but it's good enough to be workable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the special case where a tree contains no unary branching nodes, i.e. nodes that have only one child, c-command can be stated in a simpler fashion as the *composition* of the sibling relation $S$ with reflexive dominance: $C \\is \\Rcomp{S}{\\rdom}$.\n",
    "This just means that if we can reach $z$ from $x$ by first moving from $x$ to $y$ with the sibling relation and then from $y$ to $z$ via reflexive dominance, then $x$ c-commands $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=definition>\n",
    "The *composition* of two relations $R$ and $S$ is $\\Rcomp{R}{S} \\is \\setof{ \\tuple{x,z} \\mid \\text{there is a $y$ s.t.} \\tuple{x,y} \\in R \\text{ and } \\tuple{y,z} \\in S}$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=definition>\n",
    "Given a Gorn tree domain $D$ and $x, y \\in D$, $x$ *c-commands* $y$ iff $\\tuple{x,y} \\in \\Rcomp{R}{S}$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to extend this definition to trees with unary branches, the sibling relation has to be replaced by a relation that instead chooses the siblings of an appropriate node at a structurally higher position."
