    "# Partially Ordered Sets and Lattices\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial orders are particularly common and useful.\n",
    "Not just in mathematics, but also in linguistics, e.g. in semantics.\n",
    "Whenever we take a set and define a partial order over its elements, we get a *poset*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=definition>\n",
    "A *partially ordered set* or simply *poset* is a pair $\\tuple{S, \\leq}$ where $S$ is a set and $\\leq$ a weak partial order over $S$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "Both $\\tuple{\\mathbb{N}, \\leq}$ and $\\tuple{\\wp(\\mathbb{N}), \\subseteq}$ are posets.\n",
    "And so is $\\tuple{\\Sigma^*, \\sqsubseteq}$, where $\\sqsubseteq$ denotes the substring relation ($s \\sqsubseteq t$) iff $s$ is a substring of $t$).\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Posets are common mathematical structures, but they only become really interesting once a few additional properties are satisfied, turning them into *semilattices* or *lattices*.\n",
    "Let us establish the intuitions first before we cover the formal definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph below shows the set consisting of the string $abc$ and all its substrings, ordered by $\\sqsubseteq$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![mid](substringorder.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "For any two nodes $x$ and $y$ in this structure, there is at least one $z$ such that $x \\sqsubseteq z$ and $y \\sqsubseteq z$.\n",
    "Each such $z$ is an *upper bound* for $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "Visually we can identify as any node in a \"layer\" above $x$ and $y$ that can be reached from $x$ as well as $y$.\n",
    "Whenever $x$ and $y$ have multiple upper bounds, one of them is lower than all the others.\n",
    "This is the *least upper bound* (lub).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "The upper bounds of $a$ and $b$ are $ab$ and $abc$.\n",
    "The least upper bound is $ab$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upper bounds of $a$ and $\\emptystring$ are $a$, $ab$, and $abc$.\n",
    "The least upper bound is $a$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the other direction, we can also identify for all $x$ and $y$ some $z$ such that $z \\sqsubseteq x$ and $z \\sqsubseteq y$.\n",
    "Such a $z$ is called a *lower bound*, and the highest one among them is the *greatest lower bound* (glb).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "The only lower bound of $a$ and $b$ is $\\emptystring$, which is also the greatest lower bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower bounds of $ab$ and $bc$ are $b$ and $\\emptystring$, with $b$ being the greatest lower bound.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The lub and glb of $x$ and $y$ are also called their *meet* $x \\wedge y$ and *join* $x \\vee y$, respectively.\n",
    "A poset where all $x$ and $y$ have a defined meet is a *meet semilattice*.\n",
    "If all $x$ and $y$ instead have a defined join, the poset is a *join semilattice*.\n",
    "A poset that is both a meet semilattice and a join semilattice is called a *lattice*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=example>\n",
    "In the structure above, both $x \\wedge y$ and $x \\vee y$ are defined for every choice of $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "So the structure is a lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider a Gorn tree domain $D$ ordered by the reflexive dominance relation $\\rdom$.\n",
    "For any two nodes $x$ and $y$, there is some $z$ such that $z \\rdom x$ and $z \\rdom y$.\n",
    "In other words, $x \\wedge y$ is always defined and corresponds to the lowest node $z$ that reflexively dominates $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "The join $x \\vee y$, on the other hand, refers to the highest node $z$ such that $x \\rdom z$ and $y \\rdom z$.\n",
    "Such a $z$ does not exist unless $x \\rdom y$ (in which case $z = y$) or $y \\rdom x$ (in which case $z = x$).\n",
    "Therefore $\\tuple{G, \\rdom}$ is a meet semilattice, but not a join semilattice.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=definition>\n",
    "Let $\\tuple{D,\\leq}$ be a poset.\n",
    "For all $x, y \\in D$, their *lower bounds* and *upper bounds* are $\\mathrm{lb}(x,y) \\is \\setof{z \\mid z \\leq x \\& z \\leq y}$ and $\\mathrm{ub} \\is \\setof{z \\mid x \\leq z \\& y \\leq z}$, respectively.\n",
    "Their *meet* or *greatest lower bound* (glb) is $x \\wedge y \\is z$ such that $z \\in \\mathrm{lb}(x,y)$ and for all $z' \\in \\mathrm{lb}(x,y)$, it holds that $z' \\leq z$.\n",
    "Their *join* or *least upper bound* (lub) is $x \\vee y \\is z$ such that $z \\in \\mathrm{ub}(x,y)$ and for all $z' \\in \\mathrm{ub}(x,y)$, it holds that $z \\leq z'$.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=definition>\n",
    "Let $\\tuple{D,\\leq}$ be a poset.\n",
    "Then it is\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>a *meet semilattice* iff $x \\wedge y \\in D$ for all $x,y \\in D$,</li>\n",
    "<li>a *join semilattice* iff $x \\vee y \\in D$ for all $x,y \\in D$,</li>\n",
    "<li>a *lattice* iff both conditions are met.</li>\n",

    "Again you might be wondering why we care about whether a structure is a lattice or not.\n",
    "The central advantage is once again the ability to generalize.\n",
    "There are existing algorithms and techniques for working with lattices, so if a given problem can be described in terms of lattices, we are halfway toward a solution.\n",
    "In addition, it becomes easier to generalize results from one application to a completely new one if it can be shown that both are rotted in lattice structures.\n",
    "The ability to generalize specific objects into more abstract ones is tremendously useful for devising general solutions that apply to many different problems - whether you are a scientist or an engineer."
