<h1
id="supplementary-readings-or-whats-unique-about-this-book">Supplementary
readings, or: What’s unique about this book?</h1>
<p>This book is far from the only game in town when it comes to
mathematics and linguistics, and that’s a good thing. It is impossible
for a single resource to please everyone. Some readers may want more
mathematical rigor, others want to focus on the intuitions. Some want a
comprehensive tome, others a slim pamphlet. When I set out to write this
book, I wanted to create something that provides a new route into
mathematical linguistics, something that works for those readers who
bounced off the existing resources for whatever reason. So let’s take a
look at what’s already out there and how this book differs from
that.</p>
<h2
id="partee-et-al-1993-mathematical-methods-in-linguistics-second-edition">Partee
et al (1993): Mathematical Methods in Linguistics (Second edition)</h2>
<p>This is arguably the best-known introduction to mathematical
approaches to linguistics. It was a remarkable achievements at its time,
and depending on your interests it may still be the best book for you.
At almost 700 pages, <em>Mathematical Methods in Linguistics</em> is
very comprehensive and covers many topics at greater length than my
book. For example, I cover sets in a few short background units, whereas
<em>Mathematical Methods in Linguistics</em> devotes its entire first
chapter to sets. So if you feel like the treatment of some mathematical
concept is too abridged in my book, you might find a more satisfactory
treatment in Partee et al (1990).</p>
<p>The downside is that linguistic applications are mostly limited to
semantics, the study of meaning. The focus on semantics greatly shapes
what mathematical topics are covered, and hence you won’t find things
like vectors or matrix multiplication that are becoming increasingly
important in linguistics. Where the book ventures beyond semantics,
e.g. in its chapters on automata theory, it fails to make a compelling
case for their relevance to language. In a way, my book is the very
opposite of Partee et al’s in that I talk about pretty much everything
except semantics. Overall <em>Mathematical Methods in Linguistics</em>
is still an excellent read, but it should probably be called
<em>Mathematics for Semanticists</em>.</p>
<h2 id="gamut-1990-logic-language-and-meaning-volumes-1-2">Gamut (1990):
Logic, Language, and Meaning (Volumes 1 &amp; 2)</h2>
<p>This one already tells you in the title that it will be heavy on
logic and meaning, i.e. semantics. I prefer its treatment of formal
logic to that in other textbooks, and it includes less common topics
such as many-valued logic. But as with Partee et al’s <em>Mathematical
Methods in Linguistics</em>, the exclusive focus on logic and semantics
means that readers won’t get to see most of the ways mathematics can be
applied to language.</p>
<h2 id="keenan-moss-2016-mathematical-structures-in-languages">Keenan
&amp; Moss (2016): Mathematical Structures in Languages</h2>
<p>This is a much thinner book than <em>Mathematical Methods in
Linguistics</em>, and it does quite a few things to set itself apart.
While the second half of the book is still heavily focused on semantics,
the first half does branch out and also talks about things such as
feature systems in phonology (the grammar of sounds). Most importantly,
perhaps, this book has a heavy emphasis on mathematical proofs. If you
are aspiring mathematical linguist, proofs will be essential in your
research, and <em>Mathematical Structures in Languages</em> is a good
place to learn the basics of constructing mathematical proofs. But if
you just want to learn some hand-on techniques for modeling language in
an insightful manner, the abundance of proofs may prove distracting
(yes, the pun is as lame as it is intended). By contrast, I largely omit
mathematical proofs in this book, including just enough of them to
illustrate what a mathematical proof is and why it is insightful and
extremely powerful. The emphasis is on the hands-on application of
mathematical insights rather than the creation of new mathematical
insights. If you find that too limiting and want to dive into
constructing your own proofs, check out <em>Mathematical Structures in
Languages</em>.</p>
<h2 id="kornai-2008-mathematical-linguistics">Kornai (2008):
Mathematical Linguistics</h2>
<p>This is a very different kind of textbook as it targets
mathematically minded readers with no prior training in linguistics — in
particular mathematicians and computer scientists. As a result, the book
covers a very different range of topics than the textbooks listed above,
including information theory, speech processing, and handwriting
recognition, among others. This makes for a very unique contribution,
but also one that is a highly acquired taste. Linguistically-minded
reader may find the choice of topics dry or boring, shying away from the
phenomena and issues that make linguistics exciting. And readers without
any linguistic training may still find it hard to follow the linguistic
parts of the book. Overall, it is still a worthwhile read with many
things you can’t find anywhere else. Just make sure it isn’t your first
read on mathematics or linguistics (good thing you’re currently reading
a book that does work just fine as a first read).</p>
<h2 id="kracht-2003-the-mathematics-of-language">Kracht (2003): The
Mathematics of Language</h2>
<p>I consider this is the best book on this list, but it is also the
least read and/or understood. If you are an advanced reader with lots of
mathematical maturity and an excellent command of linguistics, Kracht’s
<em>Mathematics of Language</em> is a dream come true, a treasure trove
of definitions, theorems and proofs. If you are on your way to to
becoming a researcher in mathematical linguistics, it will be one of the
most enjoyable reads of your life. If you’re none of the above, this is
a 600 page paperweight. The book will simply be impenetrable to you, and
that is a shame because it has so many important things to tell you.
Hopefully, after reading my book and one of the others listed above, you
will be ready to take on Kracht’s magnum opus. It will still be very
challenging, but you should have a decent chance of survival.</p>
