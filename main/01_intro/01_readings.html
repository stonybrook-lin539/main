<h1
id="supplementary-readings-or-whats-unique-about-this-book">Supplementary
readings, or: What’s unique about this book?</h1>
<p>This book is far from the only game in town when it comes to
mathematics and linguistics, and that’s a good thing. It is impossible
for a single resource to please everyone. Some readers may want more
mathematical rigor, others want to focus on the intuitions. Some want a
comprehensive tome, others a slim pamphlet. When I set out to write this
book, I wanted to create something that provides a new route into
mathematical linguistics, something that works for those readers who
bounced off the existing resources or didn’t have them on their radar to
begin with. So let’s take a look at what is already out there and how
this book differs from that.</p>
<h2 id="comparison-to-other-textbooks">Comparison to other
textbooks</h2>
<p>In a fit of solipsistic idiosyncrasy, I will discuss the books in the
order I read them as a student.</p>
<h3
id="partee-et-al-1990-mathematical-methods-in-linguistics-second-edition">Partee
et al (1990): Mathematical Methods in Linguistics (Second edition)</h3>
<p>This is arguably the best-known introduction to mathematical
approaches to linguistics. It was a remarkable achievement at its time,
and depending on your interests it may still be the best book for you.
At almost 700 pages, <em>Mathematical Methods in Linguistics</em> is
very comprehensive and covers many topics at greater length than my
book. For example, I cover sets in a few short background units, whereas
<em>Mathematical Methods in Linguistics</em> devotes its entire first
chapter to sets. So if you feel like the treatment of some mathematical
concept is too abridged in my book, you might find a more satisfactory
treatment in Partee et al (1990).</p>
<p>The downside of Partee et al (1990) is that linguistic applications
are mostly limited to semantics, the study of meaning. The focus on
semantics greatly shapes what mathematical topics are covered, and hence
you won’t find topics like vectors or matrix multiplication that are
becoming increasingly important in linguistics. Where the book ventures
beyond semantics, e.g. in its chapters on automata theory, it fails to
make a compelling case for their relevance to language. In a way, my
book is the very opposite of Partee et al’s in that I talk about pretty
much everything except semantics. Overall <em>Mathematical Methods in
Linguistics</em> is still an excellent read, but it should probably be
called <em>Mathematics for Semanticists</em>.</p>
<h3 id="gamut-1990-logic-language-and-meaning-volumes-1-2">Gamut (1990):
Logic, Language, and Meaning (Volumes 1 &amp; 2)</h3>
<p>This one already tells you in the title that it will be heavy on
logic and meaning, i.e. semantics. I prefer its treatment of formal
logic to that in other textbooks, and it includes less common topics
such as many-valued logic and categorial grammar. But as with Partee et
al’s <em>Mathematical Methods in Linguistics</em>, the focus on logic
and semantics means that readers won’t get to see many of the ways
mathematics can be applied to language.</p>
<h3 id="keenan-moss-2016-mathematical-structures-in-language">Keenan
&amp; Moss (2016): Mathematical Structures in Language</h3>
<p>This is a much thinner book than <em>Mathematical Methods in
Linguistics</em>, and it does quite a few things to set itself apart.
While the second half of the book is all about semantics, the first half
does branch out into rarely seen topics such as feature systems in
phonology (the grammar of sounds). Most importantly, perhaps, this book
puts major emphasis on mathematical proofs. If you are aspiring
mathematical linguist, proofs will be essential in your research, and
<em>Mathematical Structures in Languages</em> is a good place to learn
the basics of constructing mathematical proofs. But if you just want to
learn some hand-on techniques for modeling language in an insightful
manner, the abundance of proofs may prove distracting (yes, the pun is
as lame as it is intended). By contrast, I largely omit mathematical
proofs in this book, including just enough of them to illustrate what a
mathematical proof is and why it is insightful and extremely powerful.
The emphasis is on the hands-on application of mathematical insights
rather than the creation of new ones. If you find that too limiting and
want to dive into constructing your own proofs, check out
<em>Mathematical Structures in Language</em>.</p>
<h3 id="kornai-2008-mathematical-linguistics">Kornai (2008):
Mathematical Linguistics</h3>
<p>This is a very different kind of textbook as it targets
mathematically minded readers with no prior training in linguistics — in
particular mathematicians and computer scientists. As a result, the book
covers a very different range of topics than the textbooks listed above,
including information theory, speech processing, and handwriting
recognition, among others. This makes for a very unique contribution,
but also one that is an acquired taste. Linguistically-minded readers
may find the choice of topics dry or boring, shying away from the
phenomena and issues that make linguistics exciting to them. And readers
without any linguistic training may still find it hard to follow the
linguistic parts of the book. Overall, it is still a worthwhile read
with many things you can’t find anywhere else. I simply advise against
it being your first read on mathematics or linguistics (my book is meant
to work just fine as a first read, and hopefully I have succeeded at
that).</p>
<h3 id="kracht-2003-the-mathematics-of-language">Kracht (2003): The
Mathematics of Language</h3>
<p>I consider this is the best book on this list, but it is also the
least read and/or understood. If you are an advanced reader with lots of
mathematical maturity and an excellent command of linguistics, Kracht’s
<em>Mathematics of Language</em> is a dream come true, a treasure trove
of definitions, theorems and proofs. If you are on your way to becoming
a researcher in mathematical linguistics, it will be one of the most
enjoyable reads of your life. If you’re none of the above, this is a 600
page paperweight. The book will simply be impenetrable to you, and that
is a shame because it has so many important things to tell you.
Hopefully, after reading my book and one of the others listed above, you
will be ready to take on Kracht’s <em>magnum opus</em>. It will still be
challenging, but you should have a good chance of survival.</p>
<h3
id="jurafsky-martin-20002008in-progress-speech-and-language-processing">Jurafsky
&amp; Martin (2000/2008/in progress): Speech and Language
Processing</h3>
<p>This is different from all the books above in that it is an
introduction not to mathematical linguistics but to computational
linguistics, in particular Natural Language Processing (NLP). There are
several reasons why it merits inclusion in this list, though. It is a
book that most students should be able to tackle after working through
this one. It presents additional applications of many concepts covered
in this book, e.g. n-grams and matrix multiplication. It uses a fair
amount of mathematical notation, but largely avoids elaborate
definitions and proofs. It also covers important topics that aren’t in
any of the books above, most importantly sentence parsing, which is the
process of assigning hidden structure to sentences.</p>
<p>A brief remark on the various editions: The second edition is a
revised and extended version of the first edition, and to the best of my
knowledge there is no reason to ever prefer the first over the second.
The third edition, however, drops some of the topics of the second
edition that aren’t all that important anymore in this age of neural
networks and large language models. However, some of the topics that
were dropped were among the most interesting from a linguistic
perspective, e.g. the discussion of finite-state optimality theory. So
my personal recommendation is to read the second edition and then
supplement that with the third edition’s chapters on neural networks,
which are a lot of fun and do a great job of illustrating the role of
matrix multiplication in neural networks.</p>
<h2 id="summary-whats-unique-here">Summary: What’s unique here?</h2>
<p>This book differentiates itself in several ways from existing
textbooks.</p>
<h3 id="choice-of-topics-structure-over-meaning">Choice of topics:
Structure over meaning</h3>
<p>While a lot of existing textbooks focus on the use of mathematics in
semantics (the study of meaning), semantics plays a very minor role in
this book. Logic is covered a bit, but only in connection to talking
about structures (i.e. model theory). Quite generally, “structure over
meaning” was one of the leading design principles for the book. The
discussion tends to revolve around phonology (sound grammar), morphology
(word grammar), and syntax (sentence grammar), which are the three
primary domains of linguistic structure. The book also ventures into
topics like grammatical inference and machine learning that are rarely
covered in linguistics textbooks. Again, this involves structure, albeit
a at a level that goes beyond individual languages.</p>
<h3 id="target-audience-consumers-not-producers">Target audience:
consumers, not producers</h3>
<p>Books in mathematical linguistics are often written for aspiring
mathematical linguists. As such, they emphasize the mathematical
framework of definitions, theorems, and proofs. They seek to give
readers all the tools they need to <strong>produce</strong> new results
in mathematical linguistics. That is a valid goal, and the field
definitely needs books like this. But every book with this goal
necessarily sets a very high bar for its readers to clear, and that
makes it a lot less approachable to most readers.</p>
<p>This book instead tries to get readers to a level where they can
<strong>consume</strong> results from mathematical linguistics. Readers
learn how to take existing insights from mathematical linguistics and
apply them to language. The focus is on model building instead of
theorem proving. The hope is that this will be more appealing to readers
who bounce of formal proofs. Reading this book won’t turn you into a
mathematical linguist, but it will allow you to understand mathematical
linguistics and how you can leverage its insights for whatever your
primary area of interest may be.</p>
<h3 id="non-linear-structure">Non-linear structure</h3>
<p>While I didn’t mention this in the discussion above, this book is
also unique in that it adopts a non-linear structure that explicitly
separates the mathematical concepts from their application to language.
This is a major difference to Partee et al (1990), Gamut (1990), and
Keenan &amp; Mos (2016), where the two are frequently interleaved. It is
also a major difference to Kracht (2003), which presumes a lot of
mathematical basics instead of gently introducing them to the reader. My
book is an attempt to have one’s cake and eat it too by covering the
mathematical background without letting it disrupt the flow of the main
content, which is the application of mathematics to language. This
design goal has specific implications for the structure of this book and
how it should be maneuvered by the reader. That is our next topic of
discussion.</p>
