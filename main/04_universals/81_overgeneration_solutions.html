<div class="exercise">
<p>Write a negative trigram grammar for intervocalic devoicing, assuming
that the alphabet consists only of <em>a</em>, <em>o</em>, <em>s</em>,
<em>z</em>, and <em>l</em>. Remember that <em>s</em> is voiceless and
<em>z</em> is voiced. Also, <em>l</em> is not subject to intervocalic
voicing.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>The negative grammar is the smallest set containing all of the
following trigrams:</p>
<ul>
<li>aza</li>
<li>aza</li>
<li>oza</li>
<li>ozo</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="solution_explained">
<p>The key insight here is that this grammar works exactly like the
grammar for intervocalic voicing we encountered in an earlier unit,
except that <em>s</em> has been replaced with <em>z</em> in all
trigrams. We can do this because our <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars have no understanding of
what these symbols actually mean, they’re all just meaningless blobs of
different shapes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Assuming the same alphabet as in the previous exercise, write a
bigram grammar (it may be positive or negative) that requires every word
to start with <em>a</em> and end with <em>s</em>.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>A negative grammar provides the smallest solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>&gt;o</li>
<li>&gt;s</li>
<li>&gt;z</li>
<li>&gt;l</li>
<li>a&lt;</li>
<li>o&lt;</li>
<li>z&lt;</li>
<li>l&lt;</li>
</ul>
<p>A positive grammar states more explicitly what we may start and end
with, but then we have to add 25 additional bigrams to capture the lack
of combinatorial restrictions within the word:</p>
<ul>
<li>&gt;a</li>
<li>s&lt;</li>
<li>any <span class="math inline">\(xy\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are symbols in alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> (without edge markers).</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way this constraint is very unnatural as no language requires
all words to always start and end with the same sounds.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Assuming the same alphabet as before, write a trigram grammar (it may
be positive or negative) for “penultimate <em>s</em>”: if a word has at
least two symbols, then the last but one symbol must be <em>s</em>.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>This is again easier to do with a negative grammar. The grammar
contains all trigrams of the form <span
class="math inline">\(xy&lt;\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is not <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is any random symbol of our
alphabet:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>No penultimate a</em>
<ul>
<li>aa&lt;</li>
<li>ao&lt;</li>
<li>as&lt;</li>
<li>az&lt;</li>
<li>al&lt;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>No penultimate o</em>
<ul>
<li>oa&lt;</li>
<li>oo&lt;</li>
<li>os&lt;</li>
<li>oz&lt;</li>
<li>ol&lt;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>No penultimate z</em>
<ul>
<li>za&lt;</li>
<li>zo&lt;</li>
<li>zs&lt;</li>
<li>zz&lt;</li>
<li>zl&lt;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>No penultimate l</em>
<ul>
<li>la&lt;</li>
<li>lo&lt;</li>
<li>ls&lt;</li>
<li>lz&lt;</li>
<li>ll&lt;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This is again a very unnatural constraint that is the result of
taking a natural one (penultimate stress) and changing what kind of
symbol it may apply to.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Suppose that English only contains the words <em>the</em>,
<em>old</em>, <em>man</em>, <em>woman</em>, <em>sleep</em>,
<em>sleeps</em>, <em>snore</em>, and <em>snores</em>. Assume furthermore
that the English subject verb agreement system works as follows: if the
subject does not contain an adjective (like <em>old</em>), then use the
inflected verb form; otherwise, use the base form. So we would get
<em>The old man snore</em> but <em>The man snores</em>. Write a trigram
grammar (it may be positive or negative) that captures this unnatural
condition.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>This is easily captured by a negative trigram grammar that contains 8
trigrams.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>With adjectives, agreement is blocked</em>
<ul>
<li>old man snores</li>
<li>old man sleeps</li>
<li>old woman snores</li>
<li>old woman sleeps</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Without adjectives, agreement is mandatory</em>
<ul>
<li>the man snore</li>
<li>the man sleep</li>
<li>the woman snore</li>
<li>the woman sleep</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Assume that our alphabet consists of <em>a</em>, <em>o</em>,
<em>s</em>, <em>z</em>, and <em>l</em>, as before. Write a bigram
grammar (it may be positive or negative) that requires every word to
consist of exactly 1 symbol. Explain why it is highly unlikely that any
natural language would have such a constraint on words.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>In this case, the positive grammar is slightly smaller:</p>
<ul>
<li>&gt;a</li>
<li>a&lt;</li>
<li>&gt;o</li>
<li>o&lt;</li>
<li>&gt;s</li>
<li>s&lt;</li>
<li>&gt;z</li>
<li>z&lt;</li>
<li>&gt;l</li>
<li>l&lt;</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the negative grammar states the requirement more
explicitly:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Have at least one symbol</em>
<ul>
<li>&gt;&lt;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Don’t have two symbols</em>
<ul>
<li>aa</li>
<li>ao</li>
<li>as</li>
<li>az</li>
<li>al</li>
<li>oa</li>
<li>oo</li>
<li>os</li>
<li>oz</li>
<li>ol</li>
<li>sa</li>
<li>so</li>
<li>ss</li>
<li>sz</li>
<li>sl</li>
<li>za</li>
<li>zo</li>
<li>zs</li>
<li>zz</li>
<li>zl</li>
<li>la</li>
<li>lo</li>
<li>ls</li>
<li>lz</li>
<li>ll</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Either way this constraint would greatly limit a language’s
vocabulary. With <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct sounds,
there could be at most <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> distinct
words. We know that every language has thousands of words, whereas the
number of sounds is usually in the dozens and at best in the hundreds.
This immediately shows that no language limits itself to words with a
single sound.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each constraint above, give a concrete example from English that
violates it.</p>
<div class="solution">
<ul>
<li><em>The further to the right a syllable occurs in a word, the more
consonants it must have</em>: Perhaps this one?</li>
<li><em>Any sequence of sounds is a possible word as long as it contains
at least as many vowels as consonants</em>: bnrpauieo</li>
<li><em>When we sort the words of a language by their length, we get the
<strong>Fibonacci series</strong>: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …</em>: a, I,
it, is, … (if one counts length in terms of characters, but it also
breaks down with sounds because there’s many words with three sounds,
and also many with four sounds)</li>
<li><em>The first word in a sentence must rhyme with the last word in a
sentence</em>: I don’t think so, no.</li>
<li><em>Every sentence must have an even number of words</em>: Every
sentence must have an even number of words.</li>
<li><em>To negate a sentence, utter it backwards</em>: “backwards it
utter, sentence a negate to” doesn’t mean that we cannot negate a
sentence by uttering it backwards — it’s just gibberish</li>
<li><em>Adjectives that start with a vowel go before the noun,
adjectives that start with a consonant go after the noun</em>: no
<em>good</em> deed goes unpunished unless it is a deed
<em>undone</em></li>
<li><em>Relative clauses follow the noun they modify if it is the
subject, but otherwise precede the noun</em>: I provide that is a
counterexample this sentence.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>::: exercise Can you think of a constraint that you are fairly
certain does not arise in any natural language?</p>
<p><em>Hint:</em> Mathematical concepts like prime numbers are very
fruitful for this.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>Oh boy, the list is endless:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The number of verbs in the sentence must be prime.</li>
<li>If a sentence contains a coordination, then the sentence must also
contain a preposition.</li>
<li>All sentences must be palindromes (they are the same from
left-to-right and right-to-left, e.g. <em>John likes John</em>).</li>
<li>A word that contains the sound <em>a</em> may not be adjacent to
word that contains an affix that marks aspect or tense.</li>
<li>If two words in a sentence could be contracted but aren’t
(e.g. contraction of <em>it</em> and <em>is</em> to <em>it’s</em>), then
the sentence may not contain any contractions at all.</li>
<li>The word order in sentences with an even number of words is the
reverse of the word order in sentences with an odd number of words.</li>
<li>If a sentence contains at least 10 words, then it must contain at
least 20 words (in other words, you cannot have sentences where the
number of words is somewhere between 10 and 19).</li>
<li>If a sentence consists of multiple subordinate clauses, then no
subordinate clause C must contain any nouns that also occur in the
clause containing C.</li>
</ol>
<p>And so on, and so on. The list is endless.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>You might think the previous example is contrived because there’s no
utility to those new classes. So let’s consider a case where utility
doesn’t even factor into things. Below is a chart showing some made-up
English words and what kind of objects this word can refer to. For
example, the first row tells us that blue circles and blue squares are
<em>blip</em>, whereas red circles and red squares are not
<em>blip</em>. Try to infer the meaning of those words from those
examples.</p>
<p><img src="nonceterms_bluered.svg" alt="nonceterms_bluered.svg" /></p>
<p>Now consider this expanded chart which also contains information
about brown objects. Is your original hypothesis still correct? Can you
make more sense of the words now, or did things just get really
confusing?</p>
<p><img src="nonceterms_full.svg" alt="nonceterms_full.svg" /></p>
<p>Once you’re done pondering those questions, go to the end of the unit
for a definition of each word. Do they strike you as particularly
natural? If not, what is it about them that makes them weird?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>They are extremely unnatural because they combine words in ways that
are not intersective. For whatever reasons, when languages combine
multiple meanings into a single word, the combination has to be via
<em>and</em>. A <em>bachelor</em> is somebody who is <em>single
<strong>and</strong> male</em>. There is no corresponding term for
somebody who is <em>single <strong>or</strong> male</em>, or for
somebody who is such that <em><strong>if</strong> they are single,
<strong>then</strong> they are male</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes we do get things that look like a combination of
<em>or</em>. For example, a <em>university employee</em> is somebody who
is <em>staff or faculty</em>. But this is an accident of how the
part-whole relation works in this case. Universities happen to be such
that their set of employees can be broken down further into subtypes.
But this isn’t a combination of multiple terms via <em>or</em>, just
like the meaning of <em>blue</em> isn’t <em>light blue or dark
blue</em>. Mathematically the two may be equivalent, but that’s not how
humans think about it.</p>
