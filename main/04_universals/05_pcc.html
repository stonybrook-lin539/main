<p>Monotonicity can be successfully invoked to explain <span
class="math inline">\(^*\)</span>ABA effects for adjectival gradation
and person syncretism in pronouns, as well as case syncretism patterns.
But languages do many other quirky things, and one particularly quirky
thing is the <strong>Person Case Constraint</strong>, short PCC.</p>
<h2 id="the-pcc-explained">The PCC explained</h2>
<p>The PCC is a restriction on <strong>clitics</strong>. A clitic is a
reduced pronoun that has attached to another word. For instance, the
English pronoun <em>her</em> is often realized as a clitic <em>’er</em>,
as in <em>I saw’er yesterday</em>.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Can you think of other clitics in English? Exemplify their use with
specific sentences.</p>
</div>
<p>English does not allow combinations of clitics like <em>I
showed’er’em</em>. Other languages do, but usually not all combinations
are okay. That’s what the PCC is about: if two pronouns belong to the
same verb, the pronouns must have certain person values. An example of
the PCC can be seen in certain dialects of French. The sentence
<em>Roger me leur a présenté</em> ‘Roger has shown me to them’ is
ungrammatical. But the minimally different <em>Roger le leur a
présenté</em> ‘Rogers has shown him to them’ is perfectly fine. In these
dialects, it is alright to combine</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>third</strong> person direct object pronoun with a
<strong>third</strong> person indirect object pronoun,</li>
</ul>
<p>but not</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>first</strong> person direct object pronoun with a
<strong>third</strong> person indirect object pronoun.</li>
</ul>
<p>A variety of PCCs have been found across languages, including French,
Spanish, Catalan, Basque, Slovenian, and most recently Choctaw, a Native
American language spoken in parts of Oklahoma, Mississippi, Louisiana,
and Tennessee. Four PCCs are robustly attested at this point. Using
1/2/3 as a shorthand for first/second/third person and DO/IO as
abbreviations for direct and indirect object, they are usually defined
as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>S(trong)-PCC:</strong> DO must be 3.</li>
<li><strong>U(ltrastrong)-PCC:</strong> DO is strictly less prominent
than IO, where 3 is less prominent than 2, and 2 is less prominent than
1.</li>
<li><strong>W(eak)-PCC:</strong> 3IO combines only with 3DO.</li>
<li><strong>M(e first)-PCC:</strong> If IO is 2 or 3, then DO is not
1.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is, to be frank, a mess. The attested PCCs look like a random
collection of conditions — if there is anything principled going on it
must be well-hidden. Or maybe not. The four PCCs above are actually yet
another instance of monotonicity.</p>
<h2 id="pccs-as-tables">PCCs as tables</h2>
<p>First, let’s summarize the facts above in a more accessible format.
Each PCC can be represented by a table where the rows indicate the
person specification of IO and the columns the person specification of
DO. For example, the U-PCC has the following table:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>U(ltrastrong)-PCC:</strong> DO is strictly less prominent
than IO, where 3 is less prominent than 2, and 2 is less prominent than
1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that we leave the diagonal empty. This is because combinations
of the IO and DO with the same person often display special behavior
that linguists believe to be due to other factors that have nothing to
do with PCCs. By keeping the diagonal empty, we effectively factor out
these special situations to focus on only those that are free of such
confounds.</p>
<p>When viewed as a table, the S-PCC only differs from the U-PCC in that
the combination of 1IO and 2DO is forbidden (so in a sense the strong
PCC is stronger than the ultrastrong PCC — don’t ask me why they are
named the way they are).</p>

</div>
<h2 id="a-hierarchy-for-pccs">A hierarchy for PCCs</h2>
<h3 id="first-attempt">First attempt</h3>
<p>If PCCs are an instance of monotonicity in some sense, then we once
again need a hierarchy of the involved elements. The PCC is a
restriction on person combinations, and we already have <span
class="math inline">\(1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3\)</span> as our person hierarchy.
But what are we supposed to do with this? In contrast to person
syncretism, the PCC doesn’t care about individual person values, it
cares about their combinations.</p>
<p>We can represent the combination of two person features <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> as a pair <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle x, y \right \rangle\)</span>. As a
convention, the first component of the pair will indicate the row in the
corresponding table, the second the column. So the pairs first give the
IO person, then the DO person.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The combination of 3IO and 1DO is <span class="math inline">\(\left
\langle 3,1 \right \rangle\)</span>. The pair <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,3 \right \rangle\)</span>, on the
other hand, represents the combination of 1IO and 3DO.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Translate between IO/DO notation and pairs.</p>
<ul>
<li>2IO, 1DO</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,2 \right
\rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,3 \right
\rangle\)</span></li>
<li>2DO, 1IO</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Using pairs, we now have <span class="math inline">\(3 \times 3 =
9\)</span> distinct elements to order.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,1 \right
\rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,2 \right
\rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,3 \right
\rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 2,1 \right
\rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 2,2 \right
\rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 2,3 \right
\rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,1 \right
\rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,2 \right
\rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,3 \right
\rangle\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>The pairs with identical components represent elements along the
diagonal and thus aren’t of importance to us. But we will still include
them for now. The question is how do we sort these 9 elements into a
hierarchy?</p>
<p>Ideally, our answer should be based on the existing person hierarchy
<span class="math inline">\(1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3\)</span>. This is actually
fairly easy. Given a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> ordered
by some relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, one can order
pairs over this set by extending the order <strong>pointwise</strong>.
That is to say, <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle u,v \right
\rangle \mathrel{R} \left \langle x,y \right \rangle\)</span> iff both
<span class="math inline">\(u \mathrel{R} x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(v \mathrel{R} y\)</span> hold. We are defining the
order of the tuples in terms of the order between their components.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>When the person hierarchy is extended in a pointwise fashion, <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle 2,1 \right \rangle &lt; \left
\langle 3,3 \right \rangle\)</span> because <span
class="math inline">\(2 &lt; 3\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1 &lt; 3\)</span>. Similarly, <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle 2,1 \right \rangle &lt; \left
\langle 3,1 \right \rangle\)</span> because <span
class="math inline">\(2 &lt; 3\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1 = 1\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,2 \right \rangle &lt; \left
\langle 1,3 \right \rangle\)</span> because <span
class="math inline">\(1 = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2
&lt; 3\)</span>. On the other hand, <span class="math inline">\(\left
\langle 2,1 \right \rangle\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,3 \right \rangle\)</span> are
unordered with respect to each other because <span
class="math inline">\(2 &gt; 1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(1 &lt; 3\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Fill each gap with <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(&gt;\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(=\)</span> as appropriate. If none of the three
fit, leave the gap empty.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,3 \right \rangle \_
\left \langle 2,2 \right \rangle\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 2,3 \right \rangle \_

<li><span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,2 \right \rangle \_

</ul>
</div>
<p>Extending <span class="math inline">\(1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3\)</span> in
this pointwise fashion yields the hierarchy below.</p>
<p><img src="pcc_hierarchy_wrong.svg"
alt="pcc_hierarchy_wrong.svg" /></p>
<p>For clarity, let’s remove all elements where IO and DO are the same,
as we have already excluded them from the PCC.</p>
<p><img src="pcc_hierarchy_wrong_reduced.svg"
alt="pcc_hierarchy_wrong_reduced.svg" /></p>
<p>Now that we have a hierarchy, we can formulate the following
hypothesis: every PCC is a monotonically increasing map from the
person-person hierarchy. But a map to what? Well, PCCs either permit a
combination, or forbid it. We can represent this by True (T) for
allowed, and False (F) for forbidden.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The U-PCC allows 1IO-2DO but not 2IO-1DO. We can view it as a
function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(f(\left \langle 1,2 \right \rangle) = T\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(f(\left \langle 2,1 \right \rangle) =
F\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Write down the 6 values of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> for
the W-PCC.</p>
</div>
<p>The set <span class="math inline">\(\left \{ \text{T}, \text{F}
\right \}\)</span> is ordered such that <span
class="math inline">\(\text{F} &lt; \text{T}\)</span>. The opposite
ordering would work just as well, but it is rarely seen because F is
usually identified with 0 and T with 1, and we have <span
class="math inline">\(0 &lt; 1\)</span>, not <span
class="math inline">\(1 &lt; 0\)</span>. As a picture:</p>
<p><img src="pcc_2.svg" alt="pcc_2.svg" /></p>
<p>This structure is commonly referred to as <strong>2</strong> (it has
only two values, after all). So now we can ask whether PCCs are
monotonically increasing maps from the person-person hierarchy to
<strong>2</strong>. At least for the W-PCC, this is indeed the case.</p>
<p><img src="pcc_hierarchy_wrong_wpcc.svg"
alt="pcc_hierarchy_wrong_wpcc.svg" /></p>
<p>For the W-PCC, there are no two pairs <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x
\leq y\)</span> without <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \leq
f(y)\)</span>. It is indeed a monotonically increasing mapping from
person combinations to True/False.</p>
<p>But things don’t quite work the way they should. The U-PCC, for
instance, is not monotonically increasing.</p>
<p><img src="pcc_hierarchy_wrong_upcc.svg"
alt="pcc_hierarchy_wrong_upcc.svg" /></p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Pick two pairs <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and use them to show that the U-PCC is
not a monotonically increasing map.</p>
<p><em>Hint:</em> What’s the main difference between the W-PCC and the
U-PCC?</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Continuing the previous exercise, show that the U-PCC isn’t a
monotonically decreasing map either.</p>
</div>
<p>Hmm, looks like not every PCC variant is a monotonic map from our
person hierarchy to <strong>2</strong>. Back to the drawing board!</p>
<h3 id="a-minor-fix-reversal">A minor fix: Reversal</h3>
<p>If you look at the PCC tables at the beginning of this notebook,
you’ll notice that grammaticality seems to spread from the top-right
corner towards the bottom-left. The difference between these PCCs is how
far grammaticality gets to spread in each direction. The top-right
corner, however, is the well-formed starting point for all PCC variants.
This should be the starting point of our hierarchy, then, and its lowest
point should be the bottom-left corner. But the top-right corner
corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,3 \right
\rangle\)</span>, whereas our person-person hierarchy starts with <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle 1,1 \right \rangle\)</span>.
Similarly, our hierarchy bottoms out at <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,3 \right \rangle\)</span>, whereas
the bottom-left corner of the table is <span class="math inline">\(\left
\langle 3,1 \right \rangle\)</span>. This suggests a somewhat
unintuitive fix: use the reversed person hierarchy for the second
component.</p>
<p>Given an ordering relation <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>,
its <strong>inverse</strong> <span class="math inline">\(R^{-1}\)</span>
is the result of literally reversing the order. So if <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is related to <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> via <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> (formally, <span
class="math inline">\(x \mathrel{R} y\)</span>), then <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is related to <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> via <span
class="math inline">\(R^{-1}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(y
\mathrel{R^{-1}} x\)</span>). The reverse of <span
class="math inline">\(1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(3 &lt; 2 &lt; 1\)</span>. Let us use <span
class="math inline">\(\prec\)</span> for this reversed order to clearly
separate it from <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>. Then we have
<span class="math inline">\(1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3\)</span> but <span
class="math inline">\(3 \prec 2 \prec 1\)</span>. Whereas before we used
<span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> for both the first and the
second component of the IO-DO pairs, we will now use <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> for the first component and <span
class="math inline">\(\prec\)</span> for the second.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First component hierarchy</strong>: <span
class="math inline">\(1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3\)</span></li>
<li><strong>Second component hierarchy</strong>: <span
class="math inline">\(3 \prec 2 \prec 1\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We will also use <span class="math inline">\(\triangleleft\)</span>
for the order in the person-person hierarchy, just to keep the three
relations visually separated. In the pointwise definition, we now use
<span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> for the first component and
<span class="math inline">\(\prec\)</span> for the second. So <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle u,v \right \rangle \triangleleft
\left \langle x,y \right \rangle\)</span> iff both of the following
hold:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(u &lt; x\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(u = x\)</span>, and</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(v \prec y\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(v = y\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="example">
<p>With this revised definition, we have <span
class="math inline">\(\left \langle 2,3 \right \rangle \triangleleft
\left \langle 3,1 \right \rangle\)</span> because <span
class="math inline">\(2 &lt; 3\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(3 \prec 1\)</span>. But for the very same reason,
<span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 2,1 \right \rangle\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\left \langle 3,3 \right
\rangle\)</span> are unordered with respect to each other.</p>

<div class="exercise">
<p>Fill each gap with <span

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Where are we at this point? Well, all the attested types of PCCs are
monotonically increasing maps over a specific person-person hierarchy.
So PCCs, which looked truly befuddling at the beginning of this section,
have turned out to be just another instance of monotonicity in language.
This is a significant success because the PCC operates at the interface
of morphology (word structure) and syntax (sentence structure).
Monotonicity really seems to be interwoven into various subareas of
language: morphology (syncretism in person pronoun systems, adjectival
gradation, and case marking), the interface of morphology and syntax
(PCC), and the interface of syntax and meaning (NPI-licensing).</p>
<p>Note that these are all very different phenomena, and linguists use
very different pieces of machinery to model and analyze them. At the
usual level of linguistic description, there seems to be no unifying
force that ties them all together. But our more abstract, mathematical
view can identify monotonicity as the central condition, with variation
stemming solely from differences in the structures that monotonicity
applies to.</p>
<p>The monotonicity account is not perfect, of course. Often there are
additional principles that need to be put in place. For instance,
adjectival gradation never displays AAB patterns of the form
<em>good</em>-<em>gooder</em>-<em>best</em>, even though those are
monotonic. Similarly, our revised person-person hierarchy allows for a
few monotonic mappings that do not correspond to attested PCCs.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Give two examples of functions from the revised person-person
hierarchy to <strong>2</strong> (i.e. the True/False structure) that are
monotonic but not one of the four PCCs. You can represent them in the
pictorial format used above.</p>
</div>
<p>Monotonicity, then, does not tell the whole story; for each domain
there are additional factors to take into consideration. But
monotonicity is sufficient to carve out a broad range of options that
need to be whittled down a bit by additional restrictions. It is truly
remarkable how much linguistic work can be done by such a simple
mathematical concept.</p>
