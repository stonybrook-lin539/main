<p>Consider the sentence <em>every student slept</em>. Does it allow for
similar inferences via entailment?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>Yes. If <em>every student slept</em>, then both of the following are
true:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Every male student slept.</li>
<li>Every sophomore slept.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Construct such an argument that <em>every</em> is downward
entailing.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>We can do this by substituting just a few terms in the example:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be the set of all
students. The sentence <em>Every student slept</em> asserts for each
student <span class="math inline">\(s \in A\)</span> that <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> did in fact sleep. Suppose this is
true. Then <em>Every X slept</em> is necessarily true if X denotes some
set <span class="math inline">\(B \subseteq A\)</span> because we
already know for each <span class="math inline">\(s \in B\)</span> that
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> did sleep. Since there is no
subset of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> for which this
entailment fails, <em>every</em> is indeed downward entailing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Represent the following sentences in terms of this functional
notation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>No professor writes good lecture notes.</li>
<li>Every professor could earn more in industry.</li>
<li>This professor, no student likes.</li>
</ol>
<div class="solution">
<ol type="1">
<li>No(professor, writes good lecture notes)</li>
<li>Every(professor, could earn more in industry)</li>
<li>No(student, likes this professor)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="solution_explained">
<p>The central thing to keep in mind here is that the arguments are
determined by meaning, not the linear order in the string. The first
argument expresses what we are quantifying over, the second one what is
being done. For the first two examples, this is straight-forward. For
the third example, we have to figure out first that <em>this
professor</em> is the object of <em>likes</em>. So the sentence means
the same as <em>no student likes this professor</em>, even though the
word order is different.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Show that <em>no</em> is downward entailing with respect to Y.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>Consider a concrete example first. Suppose <em>No student runs</em>
is true. Then <em>No student runs a 5k</em> is also true. The set of
individuals that run a 5k is a subset of the individuals that run, so we
made an inference from a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> (the
set of runners) to a subset of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>
(the set of 5k runners), which means that we have downward
entailment.</p>
<p>More generally, if <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{No}(X,Y)\)</span> is true, then there is
no individual <span class="math inline">\(i \in X\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> belongs to the set of individuals
that do <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. But then <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> cannot belong to any subset of <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, either. Or in set-theoretic terms: if
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{No}(X,Y)\)</span> is true, then
<span class="math inline">\(X \cap Y = \emptyset\)</span>, which implies
<span class="math inline">\(X \cap Z = \emptyset\)</span> for every
subset <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. This shows that <em>no</em> is
downward entailing with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Construct an example for downward entailment similar to the one above
for upward entailment.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>Again this only requires swapping out a few words:</p>
<p>Consider the sentences <em>No student ran a 5k</em> and <em>No
student ran</em>. Clearly if the latter is true, the former must be too.
We also know already that the set of students that ran a 5k (call it
<span class="math inline">\(5k\)</span>) is a subset of the students
that ran (call it <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>). So we have
<span class="math inline">\(5k \subseteq R\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now suppose that <em>no student</em><span class="math inline">\((R) =
1\)</span>. Then <em>no student</em><span class="math inline">\((5k)
\geq 1\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(5k \subseteq
R\)</span> and the function is monotonically decreasing. So the fact
that the sentence is true for <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>
entails that it is true for every subset of <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. This is exactly what it means to be
downward entailing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Alternatively, we may view downward entailment as a monotonically
increasing function if sets are ordered by the superset relation instead
of subset. Explain why!</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>By ordering sets by the superset relation instead of the subset
relation, we flip their order: if we previously had <span
class="math inline">\(X &lt; Y\)</span> (i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(X \subseteq Y\)</span>), we now have <span
class="math inline">\(Y &lt; X\)</span> (i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(Y \supseteq X\)</span>). Downward entailment means
that if a statement is true with respect to <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, then it is true with respect to every
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> that <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is a superset of. But in our new
ordering, that’s every <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(Y &lt; X\)</span>. Hence downward entailment
can be rephrased as follows: if <span class="math inline">\(f(Y) =
1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f(X) \geq 1\)</span> for
every <span class="math inline">\(X &gt; Y\)</span>. And that is an
instance of being monotonically increasing.</p>

<div class="exercise">
<p>Determine whether <em>some</em> is right downward entailing or right
upward entailing. What does this predict for the distribution of
<em>ever</em> in a sentence with <em>some</em>, and does this prediction
match your intuitions?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>Consider the sentences <em>Some student ran</em> and <em>Some student
ran a 5k</em>. Since the latter entails the former, <em>some</em> is
right upward entailing. Hence we expect <em>Some student should ever
sleep in class</em> to be illicit, which it is indeed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Determine whether <em>some</em> is left downward entailing or left
upward entailing. What does this predict for the distribution of
<em>ever</em> in a sentence with <em>some</em>, and does this prediction
match your intuitions?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>Consider the sentences <em>Some student ran</em> and <em>Some
sophomore ran</em>. Since the latter entails the former, <em>some</em>
is right upward entailing. Hence we expect <em>Some student who ever
slept in class should get a degree</em> to be illicit, which it is
indeed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>In the case of adjectival gradation, the formal universal of
monotonicity had to be supplemented with the ordering <em>positive</em>
<span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> <em>comparative</em> <span
class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> superlative, a substantive
universal. In this unit, we again used monotonicity as a formal
universal to restrict the distribution of <em>ever</em>. What is the
substantive universal we had to combine monotonicity with? Does this
strike you as a language-specific universal, or is it more likely an
aspect of human cognition in general?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>The substantive universal is the order of sets in terms of supersets.
This is not a language-specific aspect of human cognition, it is an
instance of the general ability to group objects and individuals into
groups and to establish relations between those groups.</p>
