<div class="exercise">
<p>Can you think of an example of an English adjective that does not
have a comparative and/or superlative form?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>Your answer depends on how one interprets the requirement “does not
have a comparative and/or superlative form”. Prescriptivists (a polite
term for grammar nazis) claims that there is no such thing as <em>more
pregnant</em> and <em>most pregnant</em> since you are either pregnant
or you are not. But people do say things like “this is the most pregnant
I have ever been” and nobody bats an eye. Lots of adjectives that seem
not to be gradable can be made to be gradable. Pregnancy can be
construed as a sliding scale, with week 1 barely pregnant and week 30
really, really pregnant. And once something is on a scale, it can
usually be graded.</p>
<p>However, there seem to be cases where an adjective is scalar and thus
should be gradable, yet it resists gradation nonetheless. Consider
<em>alleged</em>. This seems like it should be gradable: depending on
how many people, say, allege that the current president is a crook, the
current president may be a more alleged crook than previous presidents.
Yet “a more alleged crook” sounds really clunky. And if you do a online
search for the phrase “a more alleged”, all you find is other uses like
“a more alleged than genuine consistency”, sentences that are full of
grammar mistakes, or example sentences from linguistics papers. There is
something about <em>alleged</em> that seems to make gradation more
difficult.</p>

<p>Show that monotonicity also explains the absence of adjectival
gradation paradigms like <em>good</em>-<em>better</em>-<em>goodest</em>
if one assumes the hierarchy <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{positive} &lt; \mathrm{comparative} &lt;
\mathrm{superlative}\)</span>. Explain why this is an intuitively
plausible hierarchy.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>The paradigm <em>good</em>-<em>better</em>-<em>goodest</em>
represents a case where the positive and superlative use an A form,
while the comparative uses a B form. No monotonic function <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> can produce this pattern from the
adjectival gradation hierarchy <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{positive} &lt; \mathrm{comparative} &lt;
\mathrm{superlative}\)</span>. Note that it holds for the
<em>good</em>-<em>better</em>-<em>goodest</em> pattern that <span
class="math inline">\(f(\mathrm{positive}) = A =
f(\mathrm{superlative})\)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is monotonic increasing or monotonic
decreasing, then it must be the case that <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) = A\)</span> for every <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{positive} \leq x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x \leq \mathrm{superlative}\)</span>. The
comparative satisfies this condition (<span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{positive} \leq
\mathrm{comparative}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{comparative} \leq
\mathrm{superlative}\)</span>), yet <span
class="math inline">\(f(\mathrm{comparative}) \neq A\)</span>. Hence
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not monotonic, which confirms
the initial claim.</p>
<p>The hierarchy is intuitively plausible because it orders the three
forms by their meaning. For example, a <em>tall</em> man is not as tall
as a <em>taller</em> man, and nobody is taller than the <em>tallest</em>
man.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Earlier I mentioned briefly that no language seems to allow AAB as an
adjectival gradation pattern. Is this predicted by monotonicity? If not,
is this an undergeneration or an overgeneration problem?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>This is not predicted because the AAB pattern is monotonically
increasing: <span class="math inline">\(f(\text{positive}) =
f(\text{comparative}) = A\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(f(\text{superlative}) = B\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(A &lt; B\)</span>. This is an overgeneration
problem because our formalism predicts that AAB should exist in some
language, yet we do not find it in any language.</p>
