<p>The Person Case Constraint in the previous unit was an instance of
monotonicity regulating the shape of sentences, i.e. the
<strong>syntax</strong> of a language. It probably won’t surprise you to
hear that there is more to syntax than just the Person Case Constraint.
After all, the study of syntax has been around since at least the late
50s, and who would want to spend over 60 years studying just one
phenomenon? Syntax is a smorgasbord of intriguing, somewhat odd
phenomena. One of them is the <strong>Adjunct Island
Constraint</strong>, or simply <strong>AIC</strong>. The AIC is a
condition that holds in every natural language we currently know. It
seems to be a universal law of natural language. So what it is about? It
is about a peculiar contrast, illustrated below for English.</p>
<ol class="example" type="1">
<li>John asserted [that Mary wants to watch which movie]? (good)</li>
<li>Which movie did John assert [that Mary wants to watch]? (good)</li>
<li>John cried [because Mary wants to watch which movie]? (good)</li>
<li>*Which movie did John cry [because Mary wants to watch]? (bad)</li>
</ol>
<p>The last sentence is not okay in English, which — following
linguists’ convention — we indicate with an asterisk. But why isn’t this
sentence okay. It has all the needed words, and its meaning is perfectly
clear. Why isn’t that okay? The culprit is the AIC, or, as we will see
in this unit, monotonicity all over again. But in order to get to that
point, we first have to put in place some linguistic basics. If you’re
already familiar with the AIC, skip ahead to the section on adjunct
extensions.</p>
<h2 id="linguistic-background">Linguistic background</h2>
<h3 id="arguments-versus-adjuncts">Arguments versus adjuncts</h3>
<p>The AIC builds on the long-standing distinction in linguistics
between <strong>arguments</strong> and <strong>adjuncts</strong>, and it
states that the latter <strong>block movement</strong>. Well that’s
quite a mouthful, so let’s take it step by step, starting with the split
between arguments and adjuncts.</p>
<p>An argument is a phrase that is introduced and required by some other
word in the sentence. For example, in <em>Yesterday, John devoured
twelve pounds of pasta</em>, both <em>John</em> and <em>twelve pounds of
pasta</em> are arguments of the verb <em>devour</em>. Neither one can be
easily removed — <em>Yesterday, devoured twelve pounds of pasta</em> is
not well-formed, and neither is <em>Yesterday, John devoured</em>. So
the arguments of the verb are a necessary part of the sentence. We
cannot freely throw in additional arguments, either: <em>Yesterday, John
devoured Mary twelve pounds of pasta the whole bowl</em> is not a good
sentence of English.</p>
<p>Adjuncts, on the other hand, are much less tightly controlled than
arguments. They can be removed and added without problem. The adverb
<em>yesterday</em> in <em>Yesterday, John devoured twelve pounds of
pasta</em> is an adjunct, and indeed it can be removed without reducing
the well-formedess of the string. We can also add additional adjuncts,
e.g. the adverb <em>quickly</em> or the adjective
<em>delicious</em>.</p>
<ol start="5" class="example" type="1">
<li>Yesterday, John quickly devoured twelve pounds of pasta.</li>
<li>Yesterday, John devoured twelve pounds of delicious pasta.</li>
<li>Yesterday, John quickly devoured twelve pounds of delicious
pasta.</li>
</ol>
<p>Metaphorically speaking, arguments are the essential parts that make
up the basic structure of the sentence, like a sentence skeleton.
Adjuncts are the nice but ultimately optional embellishments that we
hang from the bones of this skeleton. That isn’t to say that adjuncts
are useless — they often provide useful or even essential information,
like <em>yesterday</em> in the examples above. But in contrast to
arguments, adjuncts aren’t needed for a sentence to be well-formed.</p>
<h3 id="movement">Movement</h3>
<p>When you compare specific sentences of a language, it often looks
like a part of the sentence has been moved around. For instance, in the
sentences below it looks like <em>this car</em> has moved from its
position next to the verb to the beginning of the sentence.</p>
<ol start="8" class="example" type="1">
<li>Mary really likes this car.</li>
<li>This car, Mary really likes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Linguists call this phenomenon <strong>movement</strong> or
<strong>displacement</strong>. Apparently the structure of sentences
isn’t fully rigid, parts can be shifted around. Sometimes they move to
the left, like in the example above, and sometimes to the right, as in
the example below.</p>
<ol start="10" class="example" type="1">
<li>The museum displayed a very old mosaic, which dates back all the way
to 200BC and allegedly depicts an Etruscan goddess, at its most recent
exhibition.</li>
<li>The museum displayed at its most recent exhibition a very old
mosaic, which dates back all the way to 200BC and allegedly depicts an
Etruscan goddess.</li>
</ol>
<p>But movement isn’t all willy-nilly, there are some restrictions. For
instance, we can’t move around the verb in the example below.</p>
<ol start="12" class="example" type="1">
<li>The museum closed its exhibition early.</li>
<li>*Closed, the museum its exhibition early.</li>
</ol>
<p>This shows that movement, just like most other aspects of language,
is subject to an elaborate system of rules and laws. The AIC is one of
those laws.</p>
<h3 id="the-aic">The AIC</h3>
<p>Let’s go back to our initial examples. The first one contains the
clause <em>that Mary wants to watch which movie</em>, repeated here:</p>
<ol start="14" class="example" type="1">
<li>John asserted [that Mary wants to watch which movie]?</li>
</ol>
<p>This clause is an argument of the verb <em>asserted</em> (removing
the argument leaves us with the rather odd <em>John asserted</em>). In
the sentence in (14), we can move <em>which movie</em> all the way to
the left. As a peculiarity of English, this also requires a form of
<em>do</em> to appear after <em>which movie</em> (in many other
languages this doesn’t happen).</p>
<ol start="15" class="example" type="1">
<li>Which movie did John assert [that Mary wants to watch]?</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let’s contrast this against the other two example sentences.</p>
<ol start="16" class="example" type="1">
<li>John cried [because Mary wants to watch which movie]?</li>
<li>*Which movie did John cry [because Mary wants to watch]?</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, <em>which movie</em> in (17) no longer gets to move
to the left edge of the sentence as it did in (15). So apparently some
law of movement has been violated. And that law is the AIC. You see,
there is a crucial difference between (15) and (17): a clause that
starts with <em>because</em> is an adjunct, not an argument. We can
completely remove it from a well-formed sentence and the result is still
well-formed.</p>
<ol start="18" class="example" type="1">
<li>John cried.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the <em>because</em>-clause is an adjunct, the AIC does not
allow anything to be moved out of it. When <em>which movie</em> tries to
sneak all the way to the left edge of the sentence, it is in violation
of the AIC. As a result, the sentence is ill-formed.</p>
<p>This is the standard linguistic story, and it is supported by tons of
evidence. The AIC seems to be active in every natural language that’s
currently known to linguists. But why should the world be this way? The
AIC looks like a pretty arbitrary law, yet it is enforced so
stringently. Why would languages limit movement out of adjuncts but not
out of arguments? Why isn’t there a single language that bucks the trend
and forbids movement out of arguments instead of adjuncts? Clearly this
isn’t some conspiracy where all languages congregated in a smoky
backroom and decided that those free-spirited adjuncts need to be taken
down a notch.</p>
<p>No, the answer is much simpler. It’s just good ol’ monotonicity
again.</p>
<h2 id="adjunct-extensions">Adjunct extensions</h2>
<p>If monotonicity is involved in the AIC, then there must also be some
underlying order over some set. Remember, monotonicity states that <span
class="math inline">\(x \leq y\)</span> implies <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) \leq f(y)\)</span> — if there is no order
<span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> to begin with, then
monotonicity is vacuous. We can get such an order directly from the
notion of adjuncts.</p>
<p>Given two sentences <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, we can order them with respect to each
other based on various criteria. For instance, we could say <span
class="math inline">\(s \leq_l t\)</span> iff the length of <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> does not exceed the length of <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Or we could say <span
class="math inline">\(s \leq_s t\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> contains at most as many slurs as <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Neither <span class="math inline">\(\leq_l\)</span> nor <span
class="math inline">\(\leq_s\)</span> are weak partial orders. Remember
that a relation is a weak partial order iff it is transitive,
antisymmetric, and reflexive. Which of these properties do not hold of
<span class="math inline">\(\leq_l\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(\leq_s\)</span>? Justify your answer.</p>
</div>
<p>Neither <span class="math inline">\(\leq_l\)</span> nor <span
class="math inline">\(\leq_s\)</span> are of any use for our problem,
though; we need something a bit more sophisticated. Instead, we will
establish an order <span class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span> between
sentences based on whether one can be obtained from the other by adding
0 or more adjuncts. In other words, <span class="math inline">\(x \leq_A
y\)</span> iff we can turn <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> into
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> by adding 0 or more adjuncts. We
say that <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is an <strong>adjunct
extension</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> iff <span
class="math inline">\(x \leq_A y\)</span>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Among the adjunct extensions of <em>John devoured twelve pounds of
pasta</em>, we find, among many others:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>John quickly devoured twelve pounds of pasta.</em></li>
<li><em>John devoured twelve delicious pounds of pasta.</em></li>
<li><em>John devoured twelve pounds of pasta yesterday.</em></li>
<li><em>John quickly devoured twelve delicious pounds of
pasta.</em></li>
<li><em>John quickly devoured twelve pounds of pasta
yesterday.</em></li>
<li><em>John devoured twelve delicious pounds of pasta
yesterday.</em></li>
<li><em>John quickly devoured twelve delicious pounds of pasta
yesterday.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <em>John devoured twelve pounds of pasta</em> is an adjunct
extension of itself. By putting parentheses around optional parts, we
can represent all of this more succinctly as</p>
<ul>
<li><em>John devoured twelve pounds of pasta</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span> <em>John (quickly) devoured twelve
(delicious) pounds of pasta (yesterday)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Besides that, all of the following also hold.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>John quickly devoured twelve pounds of pasta</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span> <em>John quickly devoured twelve
(delicious) pounds of pasta (yesterday)</em></li>
<li><em>John devoured twelve pounds of pasta yesterday</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span> <em>John (quickly) devoured twelve
(delicious) pounds of pasta yesterday</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Fill the gaps with <span class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span> or
<span class="math inline">\(\geq_A\)</span> as appropriate. If neither
<span class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span> nor <span
class="math inline">\(\geq_A\)</span> hold, leave the gap empty.</p>
<ul>
<li>John slept _ John definitely slept yesterday</li>
<li>The old man snored _ The man snored</li>
<li>John likes Mary _ Mary really likes John</li>
<li>John ate pasta _ John ate pasta</li>
<li>John ate pasta _ John ate</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Show that <span class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span> is a weak
partial order. That is to say, it is a binary relation that is
transitive, antisymmetric, and reflexive.</p>
</div>
<p>As we will see next, <span class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span>
interacts with well-formedness in a particular way. Understanding this
interaction will allow us to derive the AIC from monotonicity.</p>
<h2 id="the-adjunct-extension-semilattice">The adjunct extension
semilattice</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> be the set of all
sentences that can be built using only English words. Note that these
sentences do not have to be well-formed, so <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> contains both <em>Mary drives a fancy
car</em> and <em>car Mary a fancy fancy drive because aardvark this
seventeen allegedly</em>. The point of <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is that we want to have a collection of
all the sentences that English could in principle have if there were
absolutely no restrictions on what a natural language may look like.</p>
<p>Assuming that we have some way of identifying adjuncts, we can order
the sentences in <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> according to the
adjunct extension relation <span class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span>.
Now pick some sentence <span class="math inline">\(s \in L\)</span>. We
will write <span class="math inline">\(A_L(s)\)</span> to denote the set
of sentences in <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> that are adjunct
extensions of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[A_L(s) \mathrel{\mathop:}=\left \{  t \mid t \in
L \text{ and } s \leq_A t \right \}\]</span></p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> be the sentence <em>John
really likes Mary</em>. Then <span class="math inline">\(A_L(s)\)</span>
contains infinitely many sentences, including</p>
<ul>
<li>John really likes Mary.</li>
<li>John really, really likes Mary.</li>
<li>John really likes Mary because she looks like Sue.</li>
<li>and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>But it also includes infinitely many sentences that wouldn’t actually
be good English sentences, e.g. <em>John because yesterday she looks
like Sue adores really Mary really red</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is <em>The old
men quickly manned the boat</em>. Write down five members of <span
class="math inline">\(A_L(s)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>When we order <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> with the partial
order <span class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span>, we turn it into a
partially ordered set, i.e. a <strong>poset</strong>. We can do the same
thing with <span class="math inline">\(A_L(s)\)</span>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let’s consider a small fragment of <span
class="math inline">\(A_L(\mathit{John\ snored})\)</span>. It
contains</p>
<ul>
<li>John snored.</li>
<li>John snored yesterday.</li>
<li>John really snored.</li>
<li>John really snored yesterday.</li>
<li>Allegedly, John really snored yesterday.</li>
<li>John really, really snored yesterday.</li>
<li>John really, really, really snored yesterday.</li>
</ul>
<p>When we order these sentences by <span
class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span>, we get the structure depicted
below.</p>
<p><img src="adjunctextension.svg" alt="adjunctextension.svg" /></p>
<p>We could’ve also drawn it upside-down with <em>John snored</em> at
the top, this does not make a difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Continuing the previous exercise, draw the corresponding figure for
your fragment of <span class="math inline">\(A_L(s)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>When we order <span class="math inline">\(A_L(s)\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span>, we don’t just get any poset, we
get a particular type of poset that’s a <strong>semilattice</strong>.
More precisely, it is a <strong>meet semilattice</strong>. Nice, another
fancy term for your vocabulary, but this one sounds a lot scarier than
it actually is. You can check out the backgrounds section for all the
math, but for our purposes a visual example suffices.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider once more the fragment from the previous example, sorted by
<span class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span>. Pick two elements <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, for instance <em>Allegedly, John
really snored yesterday</em> and <em>John really, really, really snored
yesterday</em>. Put your fingers on those sentences. Now move your
fingers downward, tracing a path towards the bottom element <em>John
snored</em>. The <strong>meet</strong> <span class="math inline">\(x
\wedge y\)</span> is the earliest point where your fingers can meet. In
the case at hand, that’s <em>John really snored yesterday</em>.</p>
<p>The meet of <em>John really, really, really snored yesterday</em> and
<em>John really, really snored yesterday</em> is just <em>John really,
really snored yesterday</em>. After all, the earliest point your fingers
can meet is if you move the higher one down by one step while keeping
the lower where it is.</p>
</div>
<p>A poset is a meet semilattice iff it holds for all elements <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> that they have a unique meet. This is
the case for <span class="math inline">\(A_L(s)\)</span> no matter what
sentence we pick for <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. But there
are posets that do not meet this condition.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the structure below. Even though it is a poset, it is not a
meet semilattice because <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> have no meet.</p>
<p><img src="poset_nomeet.svg" alt="poset_nomeet.svg" /></p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>The structure below is also a poset that fails to be a meet
semilattice.</p>
<p><img src="poset_nouniquemeet.svg" alt="poset_nouniquemeet.svg" /></p>
<p>In this case, the problem is that there is no unique meet for <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Both <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> are viable choices, which violates the
requirement that the meet must be unique.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Suppose we take the set of natural numbers and order it by <span
class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span> in the usual way, yielding a single
line of numbers. Is this a meet semilattice? Justify your answer.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Finally, the structure below isn’t a meet semilattice either. Even
though it consists of two parts, each one of which forms a semilattice,
there’s many pairs of elements that do not have meet, e.g. <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. As one missing meet is enough to
prevent a poset from being a semilattice, this shows that the structure
isn’t as semilattice.</p>
<p><img src="poset_union.svg" alt="poset_union.svg" /></p>
</div>
<p>The structure in the last example is exactly what we find with the
poset <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> ordered by <span
class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span>. Each sentence <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> that does not contain any adjuncts is
the bottom element of a meet semilattice that consists of <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and all its adjunct extensions. But
<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, even though it is a collection
of such meet semilattices, is not itself a meet semilattice because
adjunct extensions of distinct sentences simply have no meet. Their
semilattices are like little islands with no land connection between
them. The poset <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> ordered by <span
class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span> is the archipelago that consists
of all these islands.</p>
<p><img src="aic_semilattices.svg" alt="aic_semilattices.svg" /></p>
<h2 id="optionality-and-well-formedness-entailments">Optionality and
well-formedness entailments</h2>
<p>All the math so far has served the purpose of identifying relations
between possible sentences. We collect all logically conceivable
sentences, including ill-formed ones, and say that if <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> can be obtained from <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> by adding finitely many adjuncts, then
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is an adjunct extension of <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. This turns a language from a simple
set of sentences into a poset whose structure encodes how strings are
related with respect to adjuncts.</p>
<p>Now remember from earlier on that adjuncts have a crucial property:
they are optional. That is to say, if a sentence containing an adjunct
is grammatical, it should still be grammatical after removal of the
adjunct.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The sentence <em>Yesterday John definitely snored loudly</em> is
well-formed, and so is every sentence that it is an adjunct extension
of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yesterday John definitely snored loudly</li>
<li>Yesterday John definitely snored</li>
<li>Yesterday John snored loudly</li>
<li>John definitely snored loudly</li>
<li>Yesterday John snored</li>
<li>John definitely snored</li>
<li>John snored loudly</li>
<li>John snored</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In the other direction, adding an adjunct cannot make an ill-formed
sentence grammatical.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The sentence <em>John meet</em> is ill-formed, and so are <em>John
meet yesterday</em>, <em>John definitely meet</em>, <em>John really,
really meet</em>, and all other adjunct extensions of the sentence.</p>
</div>
<p>If we take optionality in this sense as an intrinsic property of
adjuncts, then we can use the structure of <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> under <span
class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span> to infer the well-formedness of
one string from another. In particular, the following two laws follow
from optionality:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is well-formed, then so is
every string that <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is an adjunct
extension of.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is ill-formed, then so is
every adjunct extension of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, well-formedness travels downward in each meet
semilattice <span class="math inline">\(A_L(s)\)</span>, and
ill-formedness travels upward.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Explain why these entailments follow from the optionality of
adjuncts.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="monotonicity-derives-the-aic">Monotonicity derives the AIC</h2>
<p>Alright, so we’ve covered a lot of linguistics ground, with
arguments, adjuncts, and movement, and we’ve covered a lot of math
ground, with meet semilattices. But I promised you an explanation of the
AIC, and in particular I promised you an explanation in terms of
monotonicity. Nothing said so far has anything to do with monotonicity.
But the connection is easily made. Here’s another way of saying that
grammaticality travels downward and ungrammaticality travels upward: the
mapping from <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> ordered by <span
class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span> into the poset <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{2}\)</span> of truth values must be — you
guessed it — monotonic!</p>
<p>Consider any function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> from
<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{2}\)</span>, the structure of truth values
<span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. Usually the order on <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{2}\)</span> states <span
class="math inline">\(F \leq_2 T\)</span>, but we will switch it to
<span class="math inline">\(T \leq_2 F\)</span> (this is innocuous, it
only means that the relevant mapping will be monotonically increasing
instead of monotonically decreasing). If <span
class="math inline">\(f(s) = T\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is well-formed, otherwise it is
ill-formed.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Explain why a monotonically increasing function from <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{2}\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(F \leq_2 T\)</span> must be monotonically
decreasing if we do exactly one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>switch the order to <span class="math inline">\(T \leq_2
F\)</span>,</li>
<li>switch the order <span class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span> in
<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Now consider two strings <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(s \leq_A t\)</span>. Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(f(t) = T\)</span>. Since grammaticality travels
downward, this entails <span class="math inline">\(f(s) = T\)</span>.
But we get the very same inference from monotonicity:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(s \leq_A t\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(f(s) \leq_2 f(t)\)</span>.</li>
<li>We know that <span class="math inline">\(f(t) = T\)</span>, and
therefore <span class="math inline">\(f(s) \leq_2 T\)</span>.</li>
<li>But <span class="math inline">\(T \leq_2 F\)</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\(f(s) \leq_2\)</span> implies <span
class="math inline">\(f(s) = T\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let us look at the other case. Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(f(s) = F\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(f(t) = F\)</span> because ungrammaticality travels
upward. Once again monotonicity gives us the same inference:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(s \leq_A t\)</span>, then <span
class="math inline">\(f(s) \leq_2 f(t)\)</span>.</li>
<li>We know that <span class="math inline">\(f(s) = F\)</span>, and
therefore <span class="math inline">\(F \leq_2 f(t)\)</span>.</li>
<li>But <span class="math inline">\(T \leq_2 F\)</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\(F \leq_2 f(t)\)</span> implies <span
class="math inline">\(f(t) = F\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>And this is the key to the AIC. To recap, here’s what we’ve done so
far:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We have adopted the linguistic distinction between arguments and
adjuncts.</li>
<li>We have ordered the set of all conceivable (but not necessarily
well-formed sentences) by the adjunct extension. This gives us a poset
that is a collection of meet semilattices.</li>
<li>Because adjuncts are optional, grammaticality travels downwards in
this poset, whereas ungrammaticality travels upward.</li>
<li>We have shown that the way grammaticality and ungrammaticality
travel through the structure is once again an instance of
monotonicity.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, we have actually derived the AIC from monotonicity.
You might not see it clearly yet, but think about it. Consider once more
the contrast this unit started out with (I know, that was ages ago).</p>
<ol start="19" class="example" type="1">
<li>John asserted [that Mary wants to watch which movie]? (good)</li>
<li>Which movie did John assert [that Mary wants to watch]? (good)</li>
<li>John cried [because Mary wants to watch which movie]? (good)</li>
<li>*Which movie did John cry [because Mary wants to watch]? (bad)</li>
</ol>
<p>We have to explain why (22) is bad. But we already have! The sentence
in (22) contains a <em>because</em>-clause, which is an adjunct. This
means that (22) is an adjunct extension of <em>which movie did John
cry</em>. That’s not a grammatical sentence of English. But if <em>which
movie did John cry</em> is ungrammatical, then by monotonicity this must
also be true for all its adjunct extensions, including (22). So there
you have it, the explanation of the AIC: it’s not that movement out of
an adjunct isn’t allowed, but rather the optionality of adjuncts creates
monotonic entailment relations that simply make it impossible for such a
sentence to be allowed.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Languages do not need to be flat, unstructured sets, we can
define orders over the sentences they contain.</p></li>
<li><p>One particular order is the adjunction extension order <span
class="math inline">\(\leq_A\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(s
\leq_A t\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> can be
built by adding 0 or more adjuncts to <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>A language with this order is a partially ordered set, or
<strong>poset</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>More specifically, it is a collection of <strong>meet
semilattices</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Because of the optionality of adjuncts, we get specific
entailments over each one of these semilattices:</p>
<ul>
<li>ungrammaticality travels upward: if <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is ill-formed, then so is every
adjunction extension <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> (adjuncts cannot repair ill-formed
sentences);</li>
<li>grammaticality travels downward: if <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is well-formed, then so is every
sentence <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> that <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is an adjunct extension of (adjuncts
aren’t needed for well-formedness).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>But this is the same as saying that the mapping from <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{2}\)</span>, the poset of truth values,
must be monotonic.</p></li>
