<p>Monotonicity is not limited to morphology, it also shows up in areas
where syntax (= sentence structure) interacts with semantics (=
meaning). One instance is the licensing of <strong>Negative Polarity
Items</strong>. That’s quite a mouthful, so linguists usually say
<strong>NPIs</strong>. NPIs are a fascinating aspect of natural
languages, and they reveal just how much math languages hide under their
hood. You might not have realized it, but the language brain is really
sensitive to monotonic functions.</p>
<h2 id="a-puzzle-distribution-of-npis">A puzzle: distribution of
NPIs</h2>
<p>One of the most common NPIs in English is <em>ever</em>. If you’re a
native speaker of English, you’ve probably never noticed that
<em>ever</em> is quite a special guy, but you definitely agree that the
first sentence below is well-formed, whereas the second is clearly
bad.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>No student should ever sleep in class.</li>
<li>Every student should ever sleep in class.</li>
</ol>
<p>Quite curious, what’s going on here? One simple answer is that
<em>ever</em> can occur with <em>no</em> but not with <em>every</em>.
This is rather unsatisfying since it only states the facts rather than
explaining them. But more importantly, it is also false. Both of the
following sentences are okay in standard dialects of English.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>No student who ever slept in class should get a degree.</li>
<li>Every student who ever slept in class should get a degree.</li>
</ol>
<p>So both <em>no</em> and <em>every</em> can be fine with
<em>ever</em>, it’s only in some cases where they diverge. And when they
do, we never find cases where <em>ever</em> is okay with <em>every</em>
but not with <em>no</em>. Quite puzzling, but fortunately we have
decades of research to build on. Linguists have studied NPIs for a long
time, and one thing that has become clear is that in order to understand
the contrast illustrated above, one has to look at the meaning of
<em>every</em> and <em>no</em> from a mathematical perspective.</p>
<h2 id="entailment">Entailment</h2>
<p>One important fact about sentences with <em>every</em> and
<em>no</em> is that depending on whether they are true or false, other
sentences can immediately be inferred to be true or false. Consider the
following sentence:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>No student slept.</li>
</ol>
<p>Suppose that this is true. Then we can tell right away that both of
the sentences below are also true.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>No male students slept.</li>
<li>No sophomores slept.</li>
</ol>
<p>After all, male students are students, and sophomores are students in
their second year. If a sophomore had indeed slept, then there would be
at least one student that slept, but we already know that no student
slept. Hence it is impossible for <em>no student slept</em> to be true
but <em>no sophomore slept</em> to be false. The sentences stand in an
<strong>entailment relation</strong> such that the truth of the first
implies the truth of the other.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Consider the sentence <em>every student slept</em>. Does it allow for
similar inferences via entailment?</p>
</div>
<p>Note that the entailment only holds in one direction. Even if <em>no
sophomores slept</em> is true, it might still be the case that <em>no
students slept</em> is false — perhaps there’s a freshman or junior who
dozed off. So entailment has a directionality.</p>
<p>We can actually express the directionality of entailment by looking
at sets. Consider the set of all students. Clearly it contains all
sophomores, but the set of sophomores does not contain all students. So
the set of sophomores is a <strong>subset</strong> of the set of
students. A sentence with <em>no</em> is <strong>downward
entailing</strong>: if the sentence is true for a set <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, then it is true for all subsets of
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be the set of all
students. The sentence <em>No student slept</em> asserts for each
student <span class="math inline">\(s \in A\)</span> that <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> did not sleep. Suppose this is true.
Then <em>No X slept</em> is necessarily true if X denotes some set <span
class="math inline">\(B \subseteq A\)</span> because we already know for
each <span class="math inline">\(s \in B\)</span> that <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> did not sleep. Since there is no subset
of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> for which this entailment
fails, <em>no</em> is indeed downward entailing.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Construct a similar argument to show that <em>every</em> is downward
entailing.</p>
</div>
<p>All this talk about downward entailment is nice and dandy, but it
doesn’t really help us with our problem. We are looking for an
explanation why there are cases where <em>ever</em> is fine with
<em>no</em> but not with <em>every</em>. If both <em>no</em> and
<em>every</em> are downward entailing, then that can’t be the relevant
property to explain the contrast. But it actually is, we just haven’t
been looking in the right (or left) place.</p>
<h2 id="left-entailment-and-right-entailment">Left entailment and right
entailment</h2>
<p>To bring out the difference between <em>every</em> and <em>no</em>,
we have to make things a bit more mathematical. We shall think of
<em>no</em> and <em>every</em> as functions that take two arguments and
return either true or false.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The sentence <em>no student slept</em> can instead be written as
<em>no(student, slept)</em>, i.e. a function <em>no</em> that takes the
arguments <em>student</em> and <em>slept</em>. On the other hand,
<em>no(old man that I know, snores louder than 125db)</em> corresponds
to the sentence <em>no old man that I know snores louder than
125db</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>The intuition here is that <em>no</em>-sentences are of the general
form <em>no X does/is Y</em>, with <em>X</em> as the first argument and
<em>Y</em> as the second.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Represent the following sentences in terms of this functional
notation:</p>
<ul>
<li>No professor writes good lecture notes.</li>
<li>Every professor could earn more in industry.</li>
<li>This professor, no student likes.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>One thing the functional notation makes very clear is that a sentence
like <em>no student slept</em> consists of two distinct parts that
contribute to the meaning. The first one, represented by X, is the set
of things or objects that <em>no</em> picks from. The second one,
represented by Y, states what each one of them does. Our previous
examples of entailment only looked at X. We made inferences from <em>no
students</em> to <em>no sophomores</em> and <em>no male student</em>.
But what happens if we instead look at Y?</p>
<p>The answer is “not much” if we look at <em>no</em>. But things get
more interesting with <em>every</em>, so let us look at that one first.
Consider a sentence like <em>every student ran</em>, and contrast it
against <em>every student ran a 5k</em>. Is there an entailment here,
and if so, in what direction? Every person who runs a 5k is a person who
runs, but the opposite is not true because somebody who runs, say, 1
mile is still a person who runs, but they’re not a person who runs a 5k.
So the set of 5k-runners is necessarily a subset of all runners, but the
set of runners is not guaranteed to be a subset of the set of 5k-runners
(although this can happen if literally every runner is running a 5k). It
is also clear that if every student ran a 5k, then every student ran,
whereas the opposite does not hold. So all of a sudden the direction of
inference is the other way round — if the sentence is true for Y, then
it is true for every <strong>superset</strong> of Y. This shows that
even though <em>every</em> was downward entailing with respect to X, it
is <strong>upward entailing</strong> with respect to Y.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Show that <em>no</em> is downward entailing with respect to Y.</p>
</div>
<p>And now we have the contrast between <em>every</em> and <em>no</em>
that we need. For <em>every</em>, we see that it is downward entailing
with respect to X but upward entailing with respect to Y. This is also
called <strong>left downward entailing</strong> and <strong>right upward
entailing</strong> (because X is the left argument of the function and Y
the right argument). But <em>no</em> is both <strong>left downward
entailing</strong> and <strong>right downward entailing</strong>. Now
look once more at the example sentences from the beginning of the
notebook.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>No student should ever sleep in class. (well-formed)</li>
<li>No student who ever slept in class should get a degree.
(well-formed)</li>
<li>Every student should ever sleep in class. (ill-formed)</li>
<li>Every student who ever slept in class should get a degree.
(well-formed)</li>
</ol>
<p>For clarity, let’s rewrite this in the form of a table</p>

<p>When <em>ever</em> occurs in X, then it is fine with both <em>no</em>
and <em>every</em>, which are both left downward entailing
(i.e. downward entailing with respect to X). But when <em>ever</em>
occurs in Y, it must be with the right downward entailing <em>no</em>
rather than the right upward entailing <em>every</em>. So we finally
have our answer: downward entailing contexts allow for NPIs like
<em>ever</em>, upward entailing ones do not.</p>
<h2 id="connection-to-monotonicity">Connection to monotonicity</h2>
<p>Upward entailing and downward entailing are both instances of
monotonicity. In order to see this, we have to make our treatment a bit
more mathematical (it’s still fairly informal for mathematicians’
standards).</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> be some function that
takes as its input a set (X or Y in the notation above) and maps it to
either 1 (for True) or 0 (for False). Intuitively, you can think of
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> as a sentence with a hole in it
that must be filled by the argument.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>The sentence <em>Every male student snored loudly</em> is an instance
of the function <em>every <span class="math inline">\(\Box\)</span>
snored loudly</em> applied to the argument <em>male student</em>. The
function maps <em>male student</em> to 1 iff every male student snored
loudly.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can view the sentence as an instance of the
function <em>every male student <span
class="math inline">\(\Box\)</span></em> applied to the argument
<em>snored loudly</em>. This function, too, returns 1 iff it is true
that every male student snored loudly.</p>
</div>
<p>The domain of such a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>
consists of all possible sets of individuals and objects. For instance,
it contains the set of all students, the set of all male students, the
set of all US presidents, the set of all loud snorers, and so on. We can
order the domain by the subset relation <span
class="math inline">\(\subseteq\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(A \subseteq B\)</span> iff every member of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is also a member of <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Similarly, we order the co-domain
<span class="math inline">\(\left \{ 0,1 \right \}\)</span> in the usual
fashion such that <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now suppose that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is
monotonically increasing. Then <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq
B\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(f(A) \leq f(B)\)</span>.
Whenever <span class="math inline">\(f(A) = 1\)</span>, it must be the
case that <span class="math inline">\(f(B) = 1\)</span>. In other words,
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is upward entailing.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Consider the sentences <em>Every student ran a 5k</em> and <em>Every
student ran</em>. Clearly if the former is true, the latter must be too.
We also know already that the set of students that ran a 5k (call it
<span class="math inline">\(5k\)</span>) is a subset of the students
that ran (call it <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>). So we have
<span class="math inline">\(5k \subseteq R\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\text{\emph{every
student}}(5k) = 1\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(\text{\emph{every student}}(R) \geq 1\)</span>
because <span class="math inline">\(R \supseteq 5k\)</span> and the
function is monotonically increasing. So the fact that the sentence is
true for <span class="math inline">\(5k\)</span> entails that it is true
for every superset of <span class="math inline">\(5k\)</span>. This is
exactly what it means to be upward entailing.</p>
</div>
<p>Downward entailment works exactly the same except that the function
is monotonically decreasing.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Construct an example for downward entailment similar to the one above
for upward entailment.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Alternatively, we may view downward entailment as a monotonically
increasing function if sets are ordered by the superset relation instead
of subset. Explain why!</p>
</div>
<p>As you can see, monotonicity isn’t limited to morphological
paradigms. Without mathematics, it wouldn’t be obvious that the No
Crossing constraint of phonology has anything to do with the <span
class="math inline">\(^*\)</span>ABA generalization or the distribution
of <em>ever</em>. The abstract notion of monotonicity allows us to tie
them all together.</p>
