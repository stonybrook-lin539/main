n-grams to mappings: a failed attempt</h1>
<h2 id="underlying-representations-and-rewrite-rules">Underlying
representations and rewrite rules</h2>
<p>Our mathematical investigation of language started with phonotactics,
i.e. the laws that govern the distribution of sounds in a word. We chose
phonotactics as our starting point because it is complex enough to run
into some interesting issues, yet it is simple enough that we get to
avoid many complicating factors. But now that we are more comfortable
with the mathematical view of language, it is time to confront some of
these complicating factors head-on. For instance, phonology is more than
just phonotactics. Phonology isn’t really about determining whether a
given string is a possible word, it is about establishing connections
between strings.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>We have seen several examples of word-final devoicing, e.g. in
German. The German word for <em>song</em> is <em>li:t</em> in the
singular, with a voiceless <em>t</em>, but <em>li:der</em> in the plural
with a voiced <em>d</em> (actually, a phonetician will tell you that
German has a constricted-glottis distinction rather than a voicing
distinction, but that doesn’t matter for this example). Once we remove
the plural marker from <em>li:der</em> we are left with the stem
<em>li:d</em>. This is distinct from <em>li:t</em>, yet native speakers
of German somehow know that these are both just different outputs of the
same lexical item for <em>song</em>. They know that these two forms are
phonologically related to each other.</p>
</div>
<p>Given these relations between surface forms, phonologists have argued
that phonology actually involves <strong>underlying
representations</strong> (URs) that are modified via <strong>rewrite
rules</strong> to yield the surface forms that we actually see.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>One could say that German has a UR <em>li:d</em> for <em>song</em>.
If we want the plural of that, we use a rewrite rule that appends the
plural marker <em>er</em> to this UR, yielding <em>li:der</em>. The
singular of <em>li:d</em>, on the other hand, has no special marker, so
the rule for singular would not add any pronounced material to the UR.
But this means that the UR is subject to the rewrite rule for word-final
devoicing, which replaces <em>d</em> with <em>t</em>, yielding
<em>li:t</em>. Hence both <em>li:der</em> and <em>li:t</em> are surface
forms of the same UR <em>li:d</em>, which explains why native speakers
of German can recognize them as related forms even though they only
share <em>l</em> and <em>i:</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>There are many excellent phonology textbooks that explain the
appropriate use of URs and rewrite rules in great detail. We do not need
to worry about these details, but we do want to be able to say something
about these proposals from a mathematical perspective. Are they more
powerful than the n-gram models we used for phonotactics? Are there
certain normal forms that we can use to make our life as researchers
easier, just like we could switch between positive and negative n-gram
grammars as we see fit? Just what exactly are we claiming about
phonology if we say it can be described in terms of mappings from URs to
surface forms?</p>
<h2 id="n-grams-for-mappings">N-grams for mappings</h2>
<p>In previous chapters, it usually worked well for us to take a simple
model, ideally one we have encountered before, and make some small
tweaks to it in order to capture some new phenomenon. It sure seems like
a good idea, then, to try to take our familiar n-gram grammars and
generalize them in a way that allows them to capture mappings.</p>
<p>Suppose, then, that we use an enriched format of n-grams where one
specific symbol in the n-gram can be rewritten as something else.
Instead of the n-gram <em>abc</em>, we would now have a mapping n-gram
<em>ab[d]c</em> to indicate that <em>b</em> can be rewritten as
<em>d</em>, provided that <em>b</em> is surrounded by <em>a</em> and
<em>c</em>. Given some UR, padded out with edge markers, we build the
corresponding surface form by moving through the UR from left to right
and checking for each symbol <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>
whether there is a matching mapping n-gram. If there is not, we add
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> to the surface form. But if
there is such a matching mapping n-gram, we instead a new symbol to the
surface form according to the rewrite specification in the mapping
n-gram.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>When we looked at word-final devoicing as a phonotactic constraint,
we treated it as a ban against voiced segments like <em>d</em>,
<em>v</em>, or <em>z</em> at the end of the word. Formally, we captured
this with the bigrams <em>d⋉</em> and <em>v⋉</em> and <em>z⋉</em>. If we
want to treat word-final devoicing as a mapping, we have to rewrite URs
such that word-final <em>d</em>, <em>v</em>, and <em>z</em> become
<em>t</em>, <em>f</em>, and <em>s</em>, respectively. The corresponding
bigrams look as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>d[t]⋉</li>
<li>v[f]⋉</li>
<li>z[s]⋉</li>
</ul>
<p>Now consider how these n-grams are used to map German <em>li:d</em>
to the surface form <em>li:t</em>. First, since they are bigrams, we
have to pad out <em>li:d</em> with one edge marker on each side,
yielding <em>⋊li:d⋉</em>. Then, we move through this string from left to
right, checking each symbol. If we find a matching configuration for
some symbol, we carry out the corresponding rewrite step:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>⋊</em>, no match, add <em>⋊</em> to surface form</li>
<li><em>l</em>, no match, add <em>l</em> to surface form</li>
<li><em>i:</em>, no match, add <em>i:</em> to surface form</li>
<li><em>d</em>, matched by <em>d⋉</em>, add <em>t</em> to surface
form</li>
<li>⋉, no match, add ⋉ to surface form</li>
</ul>
<p>The only matching configuration is <em>d⋉</em>, so we replace
<em>d</em> with <em>t</em> while keeping everything else the same. After
removal of edge markers, we are left with <em>li:t</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>The English plural marker has multiple forms that are phonologically
conditioned. Roughly speaking, we get</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><em>es</em> after <em>s</em>, <em>z</em>, <em>ʃ</em>, and
<em>tʃ</em>,</li>
<li><em>s</em> after any other voiceless consonants (e.g. <em>t</em>,
<em>k</em>),</li>
<li><em>z</em> everywhere else (that is to say, after vowels and voiced
consonants).</li>
</ol>
<p>Assume that a form like <em>gases</em> is underlyingly <em>gasP</em>,
where P is a single abstract symbol indicating plural. Provide a list of
n-grams that rewrite P as the correct surface form. For simplicity, you
may assume that the alphabet only consists of <em>g</em>, <em>s</em>,
<em>t</em>, <em>a</em>, and <em>e</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Specify the mapping n-grams for intervocalic voicing. You may assume
that the alphabet only consists of <em>a</em>, <em>o</em>, <em>s</em>,
<em>z</em>, and <em>l</em>.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="problems-with-mapping-n-grams">Problems with mapping
n-grams</h2>
<p>Our mapping n-grams have multiple problems. First of all, it is
unclear what should be done when we have multiple matching mapping
n-grams.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose that we have some language German’ that works exactly like
German except that it also has a ban against clusters that consist of a
nasal followed by a voiced plosive. When such a cluster is encountered,
the voiced plosive is removed. For instance, <em>nd</em> is reduced to
<em>n</em>. We can capture this with the mapping bigram <em>nd[<span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>]</em>, where replacing
<em>d</em> with the empty string amounts to removal of <em>d</em>. But
then we run into an issue with words like <em>land</em> (which has the
same meaning as English <em>land</em>). According to the mapping bigram
<em>nd[<span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>], we should
delete </em>d* and thus end up with <em>lan</em>. But the mapping bigram
<em>d[t]⋉</em> for word-final devoicing requires us to replace
<em>d</em> with <em>t</em> so we get <em>lant</em>. Well, which one is
it?</p>
</div>
<p>Phonologists avoids issues of this kind by assuming that rewrite
rules are ordered. If two rules <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> could both apply, we always
apply <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> first. If this means that
<span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> can on longer apply, we skip
that rewrite rule.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose that word-final devoicing precedes all other rules of
German’. Then <em>land</em> must be realized as <em>lant</em> because
<em>d[t]⋉</em> takes precedence over <em>nd[<span
class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>]</em>.</p>
</div>
<p>While this certainly fixes the problem, it is quite a deviation from
n-gram grammars, which we defined as sets exactly because there is no
order between the n-grams. Of course we could now go from sets to
posets, but that opens a giant can of worms: can we use any partial
order, or does it have to be linear order, or something in between like
a lattice? That’s a lot of added complexity that we would like to
avoid.</p>
<p>But beyond this impediment to our own laziness, there are also some
serious empirical issues. Iterative processes, for example, seem to be
impossible to capture this way. You might remember the case of vowel
harmony. In terms of phonotactics, vowel harmony is a ban against vowels
of distinct harmony classes appearing in the same word. But as a mapping
from URs to surface forms, it means that a vowel that isn’t in the right
harmony class is replaced with a vowel that does meet the harmony
requirement. Crucially, vowel harmony can apply iteratively, with the
replacement of one vowel triggering the replacement of the next vowel
after that. This seems to be impossible to pull off with mapping
n-grams.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Suppose that we have a language with two classes of harmonic vowels:
bright (B) and dark (D). If a B is followed by a D (ignoring vowels),
then D is replaced by B. But crucially, this replacement can itself
trigger another replacement of a D by a B. Such a sequence of rewrite
steps is shown below.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>CBCDCD</li>
<li>CBCBCD</li>
<li>CBCBCB</li>
</ol>
<p>This would not work with mapping n-grams. Suppose our input is
<em>CBCDCD</em>. We go through the string from left to right and
incrementally build up a surface form. Suppose we use mapping trigrams
like <em>BCD[B]</em>. This will allow us to rewrite the first <em>D</em>
in <em>CBCDCD</em> with <em>B</em>. At that point, the surface form is
<em>CBCB</em>. However, the UR is still <em>CBCDCD</em> because we are
not making any changes to the UR, we are simply building a corresponding
surface form from scratch. But then, once we reach the second <em>D</em>
in the UR, the mapping trigram <em>BCD[B]</em> does not actually match —
the context in the UR is <em>DCD</em>, not <em>BCD</em>. And since we
can build arbitrarily long URs of this form, this problem will arise
even if we use ludicrously large n-grams, e.g. 17-grams.</p>
</div>
<p>The problem here is that we use URs to determine whether a mapping
n-gram has a match, and since URs do not change, we miss cases where
application of an earlier rewrite step did actually yield a matching
configuration. We could fix this by allowing mapping n-grams to specify
whether the match should be checked for the UR or the surface form. But
that’s yet another complicating factor in what is quickly becoming a
much more complicated system than the simple n-gram grammars we had for
phonotactics.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Matching n-grams also run into issues with unbounded processes like
sibilant harmony. Suppose that <em>s</em> becomes <em>ʃ</em> after
<em>ʃ</em>, no matter how far the two are apart. For instance,
<em>ʃtojowonowas</em> would become <em>ʃtojowonowaʃ</em>. Explain why
this cannot be handled with matching n-grams if the number of
intervening segments is truly unbounded.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Continuing the previous exercise, suggest a way matching n-grams
could be amended to handle such unbounded dependencies.</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, matching n-grams do not seem to address the primary reason
why we moved to mappings in the first place: native speakers’ ability to
quickly and effortlessly establish relations between strings. Matching
n-grams provide an easy way to map a UR to a surface form, but speakers
primarily do the opposite, they map surface forms to URs in order to
establish whether they are connected in some way. This is a messy
process with mapping n-grams.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Suppose you are given the following mapping n-grams.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>n[m]p</li>
<li>mp[<span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>]</li>
<li>a[a:]mp</li>
<li>a:[a]⋉</li>
</ol>
<p>Which of the following are URs from which one can obtain the surface
form <em>a:mpa</em>? Assume that the mapping n-grams must match the UR,
not the surface form or something else.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>ampa:</li>
<li>ampa</li>
<li>a:mpa:</li>
<li>a:mpa</li>
<li>anpa:</li>
<li>anpa</li>
<li>a:npa:</li>
<li>a:npa</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>We could plow ahead and fix all these issues with brute-force
stipulations, idiosyncratic additions and restrictions, and quite
generally just keep hammering away at the problem until we’ve pushed
that square peg through the round hole. Or we could take the hint that
we’re not quite thinking about this the right way and look for an
alternative. In the next unit, we’ll take a mathematically more natural
starting point and we will see that this gives us pretty much everything
one could want for phonology.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<ul>
<li>Phonotactics is a very reductionist view of phonology. A native
speaker’s mental grammar of phonology isn’t just a collection of
well-formedness conditions, it allows them to identify principled
connections between strings that may look very different.</li>
<li>Phonologists capture this by positing a split between surface forms
and <strong>underlying representations</strong>, with the former
obtained from the latter via rewrite rules.</li>
<li>Extending n-grams from phonotactics to mappings does not work well
and runs into issues with rule ordering, iterativity, and recoverability
of URs.</li>
