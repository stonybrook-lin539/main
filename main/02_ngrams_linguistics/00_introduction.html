<p>This chapter presents a very simple model of a very simple domain of
language: <strong>phonotactics</strong>. Phonotactics refers to the
rules and laws that determine in what order sounds may occur in a word.
We will model phonotactics using some very simple machinery built on top
of <strong>n-grams</strong>. The simplicity of the model will allow us
to study its behavior with mathematical methods. While some of the
results we learn in the process will be fairly mundane, others will be
surprising.</p>
<p>The core insight of this chapter is that mathematics can teach us
things about language by providing a deeper understanding of a
linguistic model of language. The model serves as the intermediary that
connects mathematics and language. In later chapters, we will apply
mathematics directly to empirical data. Both are common and highly
insightful ways of using mathematics in the study of language.</p>
