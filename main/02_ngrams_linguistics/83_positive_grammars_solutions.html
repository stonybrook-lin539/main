<li>We have to forbid trigrams of the form <span
class="math inline">\(xyz\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> are vowels and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is a voiceless fricative. The exercise
tells us that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> can be <em>a</em>, <em>i</em>, or
<em>u</em>, and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> can be <em>s</em>
or <em>f</em>. After carrying out all possible substitutions of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, we get the list of forbidden trigrams
above.</li>
<li>If <em>n</em> must be <em>m</em> before <em>b</em> or <em>p</em>,
this means that we can never have an <em>n</em> followed by <em>b</em>
or <em>p</em> (because then we would have a case where <em>n</em> failed
to turn into <em>m</em>). Hence we forbid the bigrams <em>nb</em> and
<em>np</em>.</li>
<li>The exercise describes local dissimilation as a process where
<em>r</em> changes to <em>l</em> if it is followed by <em>Vr</em>. In
terms of phonotactics, this means that we cannot have <em>r</em>
followed by <em>Vr</em>. Replacing <em>V</em> with all possible choices
for a vowel, we get the forbidden trigrams <em>rar</em>, <em>rir</em>,
and <em>rur</em>.</li>
<li>This one is tricky because we have to consider multiple cases. If a
word has just one syllable, then it is not subject to the penultimate
stress rule (which only applies to words with at least two syllables),
and hence stress falls on the last syllable in this case. In other
words, monosyllabic words must be of the form <span
class="math inline">\(\acute{\sigma}\)</span>, whereas <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is not allowed. If a word has
exactly two syllables, then it must be of the form <span
class="math inline">\(\acute{\sigma} \sigma\)</span> because the other
option <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \acute{\sigma}\)</span> would
violate the penultimate stress rule. And if a word has three or more
syllables, then it must be of the form <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma^+ \acute{\sigma} \sigma\)</span>. Based on
this, we can deduce what must be forbidden: First, we do not want to
allow words like <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, so our
grammar must contain the forbidden trigram <span
class="math inline">\({\rtimes} \sigma {\ltimes}\)</span>. We also do
not want to allow any word with at least two syllables where stress
falls on the last syllable, and thus we add the forbidden trigram <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma \acute{\sigma} {\ltimes}\)</span>. We do
not want to allow any word that ends with two unstressed syllables,
which we capture with the forbidden trigram <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma \sigma {\ltimes}\)</span>. The combination
of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \acute{\sigma} {\ltimes}\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \sigma{\ltimes}\)</span>
guarantees that if a word has at least two syllables, the last but one
is stressed. But that’s not quite enough, we also have to ensure that
this is the only syllable that is stressed. That is the same as saying
that we do not to allow any word where the stressed syllable is followed
by at least two unstressed syllables, and thus we also forbid the
trigram <span class="math inline">\(\acute{\sigma} \sigma
\sigma\)</span>. And that’s it, nothing else is required.</li>

<li><em>de-</em>: It could be a unigram consisting just of the morpheme
<em>de-</em>, or a trigram that consists of the characters <em>d</em>,

<li><em>mpi</em>: The only reasonable treatment here is as a trigram
consisting of the characters <em>m</em>, <em>p</em>, and

<li><em>John likes Mary</em>: This could be a trigram that consists of
the words <em>John</em>, <em>likes</em>, and <em>Mary</em>, or a 4-gram
that consists of the morphemes <em>John</em>, <em>like</em>, <em>s</em>,

<div class="exercise">
<p>Many languages only allow syllables of the form <em>CV</em>, where C
is some consonant and V is a vowel. In these languages, words are of the
from <em>CV</em>, <em>CVCV</em>, <em>CVCVCV</em>, and so on. Write both
a positive and a negative grammar that only allows strings of this form.
Is one grammar significantly smaller than the other?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>The positive grammar contains</p>
<ul>
<li>⋊C</li>
<li>CV</li>
<li>VC</li>
<li>V⋉</li>
</ul>
<p>The negative grammar is of the form</p>
<ul>
<li>⋊V</li>
<li>CC</li>
<li>VV</li>
<li>C⋉</li>
<li>⋊⋉ (which is needed to rule out the empty string)</li>
</ul>
<p>The two grammars are of comparable size.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Continuing the previous exercise, suppose that we use actual
consonants and vowels instead of the abstract symbols C and V. Assume
that the language has 5 consonants (<em>p</em>, <em>t</em>, <em>k</em>,
<em>s</em>, <em>f</em>) and only one vowel (<em>a</em>). So this
language allows strings like <em>papa</em> or <em>tasa</em>, but not
<em>tas</em>, <em>psafa</em>, or <em>saaka</em>. Write both a positive
and a negative grammar that only allows strings of this form. Is one
grammar significantly smaller than the other?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>We have to replace each bigram with a list of bigrams based on the
available substitutions for C and V.</p>
<p>The positive grammar now contains</p>
<ul>
<li>instead of ⋊C: ⋊p, ⋊t, ⋊k, ⋊s, ⋊f</li>
<li>instead of CV: pa, ta, ka, sa, fa</li>
<li>instead of VC: ap, at, ak, as, af</li>
<li>instead of V⋉: a⋉</li>
</ul>
<p>The negative grammar now contains</p>
<ul>
<li>instead of ⋊V: ⋊a</li>
<li>instead of CC: pp, pt, pk, ps, pf, tp, tt, tk, ts, tf, kp, kt, kk,
ks, kf, sp, st, sk, ss, sf, fp, ft, fk, fs, ff</li>
<li>instead of VV: aa</li>
<li>instead of C⋉: p⋉, t⋉, k⋉, s⋉, f⋉</li>
<li>still ⋊⋉ (which is needed to rule out the empty string)</li>
</ul>
<p>The positive grammar with 16 bigrams is now only half the size of the
negative grammar with 33 bigrams. If we increased the number of vowels,
that would bring the positive grammar closer to the negative one. Quite
generally, if the number of vowels and consonants is the same, then the
negative grammar will be larger than the positive one by one bigram
(which is ⋊⋉). The larger the difference between the number of vowels
and the number of consonants, the more the size of the negative grammar
will exceed that of the positive grammar.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following phenomena, write a positive <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar that handles it correctly.
For some of them, you have to rephrase the phenomenon as a phonotactic
constraint first. You will also have to make assumptions about the sound
inventory of the language.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>intervocalic voicing</strong>: voiceless fricatives (assume
<em>s</em> and <em>f</em>) may not occur between vowels (assume
<em>a</em>, <em>i</em>, <em>u</em>)</li>
<li><strong>local assimilation</strong>: <em>n</em> must be <em>m</em>
before <em>b</em> or <em>p</em></li>
<li><strong>local disimilation</strong>: <em>rVr</em> becomes
<em>lVr</em>, where <em>V</em> is <em>a</em>, <em>i</em>, or
<em>u</em></li>
<li><strong>penultimate stress</strong>: in words with at least two
syllables, stress falls on the last but one syllable (assume that words
are strings of stress syllables (<span
class="math inline">\(\acute{\sigma}\)</span>) and unstressed syllables
(<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>))</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’re done, contrast the positive grammars against the negative
ones from an earlier exercise. Can you identify some general guidelines
for when a positive grammar is preferable to a negative one?</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>This exercise requires a lot more assumptions than the one for
negative grammars. The problem is that it is not enough to know how
intervocalic voicing works, we also have to know what the rest of the
language looks like. Consider the case of intervocalic voicing. With the
negative grammar, it was enough to say that <em>s</em> and <em>f</em>
may not occur between the vowels <em>a</em>, <em>i</em>, and <em>u</em>.
With the positive grammar, we instead have to allow for every possible
trigram except the ones where <em>s</em> or <em>f</em> occurs between
<em>a</em>, <em>i</em> and <em>u</em>. But we do not actually know what
the set of all possible trigrams is because the exercise does not
specify the alphabet. If the alphabet contains only <em>a</em>,
<em>i</em>, <em>u</em>, <em>s</em>, <em>f</em>, and <em>k</em>, then the
set of possible trigrams is much smaller compared to an alphabet that
also contains all the other consonants of English.</p>
<p>For this reason, each answer must always specify the assumed
alphabet. And ideally, this alphabet will be small to reduce the number
of <em>n</em>-grams that need to be written down. Even then, though,
these grammars will be very large. They contain all possible <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams except the ones that were listed
in the negative grammar.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>English allows for <em>nature</em>, <em>natural</em>,
<em>naturalize</em>, <em>denaturalize</em>, <em>naturalization</em>, and
<em>denaturalization</em>, but not <em>denature</em> or any other
misordered forms like <em>naturizalation</em> (actually there is a
technical term <em>denature</em>, but it is not very common and we’ll
exclude it here to keep the exercise simple). Write a grammar that
generates all the well-formed forms but none of the ill-formed ones. It
is up to you whether you want to use a positive or a negative grammar.
If you use a negative grammar, it can be in the mixed format, with <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams of varying lengths.</p>
<div class="solution">
<p>A mixed negative grammar is the easiest option here. As our alphabet,
we assume the morphemes <em>de-</em>, <em>nature</em>, <em>-al</em>,
<em>-ize</em>, and <em>-ation</em>. The negative grammar then contains
the following <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You must start with <em>de-</em> or <em>nature</em>: ⋊ -al, ⋊ -ize,
⋊ -ation</li>
<li><em>de-</em> can only be followed by <em>nature</em>: de- de-, de-
-al, de -ize, de -ation, de ⋉</li>
<li><em>nature</em> can only be followed by <em>-al</em> or the end of
the word: nature de-, nature nature, nature -ize, nature -ation</li>
<li><em>-al</em> can only be followed by <em>-ize</em> or the end of the
word: -al de-, -al nature, -al -al, -al -ation</li>
<li><em>-ize</em> can only be followed by <em>-ation</em> or the end of
the word: -ize -de, -ize nature, -ize -al, -ize -ize</li>
<li><em>-ation</em> can only be followed by the end of the word: -ation
-de, -ation nature, -ation -al, -ation -ize, -ation -ation</li>
<li>Do not end in <em>denature</em> or <em>denatural</em>: de- nature ⋉,
de- nature -al ⋉</li>
