<h1 id="making-n-grams-more-powerful-phonological-tiers">Making n-grams
more powerful: Phonological tiers</h1>
<p>We started this chapter with <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars as a basic model for
studying the linguistic domains of phonotactics and morphotactics,
i.e. the rules that govern the arrangement of sounds and parts of word
like <em>un-</em>, <em>re-</em>, <em>-ly</em>, <em>-ize</em>,
<em>-ation</em>, <em>-s</em>, and so on. We have learned a lot about
these grammars. Positive and negative grammars are equally powerful, and
the larger the value of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the more
patterns can be captured with <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars. But is there something
like a cutoff point of language, some value of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that allows us to handle all aspects of
phonotactics and morphotactics? The answer is no, and in fact, things
are even worse: there are phenomena that we cannot capture with our
current <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars no matter
how large a value of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> we pick.
That’s not good, but not too hard to fix, either.</p>
<h2 id="the-limits-of-n-gram-grammars">The limits of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars</h2>
<p>We already know that (positive/negative) <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars can be used to describe
various kinds of conditions on natural language phonotactics and
morphotactics. This includes word-final devoicing, intervocalic voicing
or penultimate stress, where primary stress must fall on the last but
one syllable in a word. For some patterns, though, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars can be really clunky.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Vowel harmony is a common phenomenon where certain vowels cannot
co-occur in a given word. This happens in Hungarian, Finnish, Korean,
and many other languages. Take the case of Korean. Korean distinguishes
three classes of vowels: bright (B), mid dark (M), and high dark (H).
Let us ignore H for now and consider only words where all vowels belong
to class B or to class M. This is actually an exclusive <em>or</em>: no
word may mix vowels of class B with vowels of class M. Can we express
this with an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar? Yes,
but it isn’t exactly nice.</p>
<p>First, we need to consider the Korean syllable template. The most
complex syllables in Korean are of the form CGVC, where V is a vowel as
usual, C is a consonant as usual, and G is a subtype of consonant called
a <em>glide</em>. But there is an independent constraint that no two
vowels can be separated by more than two consonants. All we have to do
is to rule out that these two vowels belong to different classes, which
we can do very easily with a negative grammar that mixes <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams of varying lengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>BM</li>
<li>MB</li>
<li>BCM</li>
<li>MCB</li>
<li>BCCM</li>
<li>MCCB</li>
</ul>
<p>This looks pretty neat, so why did I say that <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars do not handle this well?
The problem is that the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram
grammars do not operate with abstract classes like this, they work with
segments. Korean has 19 consonants, which means the single 4-gram BCCM
actually corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(19 \times 19 =
361\)</span> 4-grams. Actually, it’s even more than that because we
haven’t yet replaced the abstract symbols B and M by the corresponding
vowels. Even if we refrain from doing that and only replace C with all
possible consonants, we are looking at over 700 <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams. Replace B and M and the count
will be in the thousands, and if you want to pad everything out to <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-grams, it will be in the tens of
thousands.</p>
</div>
<p>That an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar of Korean
vowel harmony needs so many <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams
does not seem right, for two reasons. First, it is strange that a simple
and natural process like vowel harmony cannot be stated in a unified
fashion and should require tons of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams. Second, it is even stranger that
the number of consonants should impact how elegantly we can describe
vowel harmony. Vowel harmony does not care about consonants, so why
should the appeal of our model hinge on the language’s consonant
inventory?</p>
<div class="example">
<p>For an even more extreme example, consider the case of
<strong>Samala</strong>, which belongs to the group of Chumash languages
spoken in southern California. Samala displays a constraint known as
<strong>long-distance sibilant harmony</strong>. All sibilants in a word
must agree in anteriority, no matter how far apart they are. This means
that a word can certainly contain multiple instances of <em>s</em> or
multiple instances of <em>ʃ</em> (ʃ is the IPA symbol corresponding to
English <em>sh</em>). But it may never contain a mixture of the two. So
<em>haʃxintilawaʃ</em> is well-formed, whereas <em>hasxintilawaʃ</em>
and <em>haʃxinitilawas</em> are both ill-formed. The form
<em>hasxintilawas</em>, while not an actual word of Samala, would also
obey the sibilant harmony constraint.</p>
<p>Even a 10-gram grammar cannot capture these contrasts. A negative
10-gram grammar that generates both <em>hasxinitilawas</em> and
<em>haʃxintilawaʃ</em> must not forbid any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>sxintilawa</em></li>
<li><em>xintilawas</em></li>
<li><em>ʃxintilawa</em></li>
<li><em>xintilawaʃ</em></li>
</ul>
<p>But then this grammar would also allow for the illicit
<em>hasxintilawaʃ</em> and <em>haʃxintilawas</em>. Only an 11-gram
grammar could capture the contrast.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Write an 11-gram grammar that generates… you know what, no, don’t do
that, life is too short to write 11-gram grammars. Instead, try to
estimate how many <span class="math inline">\(11\)</span>-grams a
negative <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar would need
so that it can generate <em>hasxintilawas</em> and
<em>haʃxintilawaʃ</em> but still rules out <em>hasxintilawaʃ</em> and
<em>haʃxinitilawas</em>. You may make the following simplifying
assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The only vowel and consonants are those that occur in the words
above.</li>
<li>There are no restrictions on the syllable template. That is to say,
each position may be any one of the available vowels and consonants
irrespective of the surrounding context.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Actually, Samala has even longer words with instances of sibilant
harmony. For example, <em>ʃtajanowonowaʃ</em> is attested whereas
<em>stajanowonowaʃ</em> is illicit. Are 11-grams still enough to handle
this? If not, what is the new value of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and how does that alter your estimate
of a negative <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars size?
Would you say that this is a large grammar?</p>
</div>
<p>Samala’s long-distance sibilant harmony can be handled by <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars, but not in an elegant
fashion. Moreover, it only works because we assume that there is some
upper bound <span class="math inline">\(k &lt; n\)</span> such that
sibilants in a Samala word are never separated by more than <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> symbols. That is technically true, but
the value of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> may increase as new
words are added to the language. If that causes <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to become larger than <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the whole <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar would have to be tossed
out and be replaced with one that uses a larger <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Again this does not seem right. The
shape of our sibilant harmony grammar should not be contingent on a
completely unrelated property such as the length of the longest word in
Samala. But we cannot do away with this unrelated property: without an
upper bound on the distance between sibilants, sibilant harmony simply
cannot be captured by any <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram
grammar.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Let us return to Korean vowel harmony one more time in order to
illustrate the problem. This time around, we will also consider the high
dark vowels in class H. These are neutral vowels, which means that they
can occur together with bright (B) or mid dark (M) vowels. So possible
Korean words are CBCHCHCB and CMCHCHCM, among many others, but not
CBCHCHCM or CMCHCHCB, where we have B and M in the same word, albeit
separated by several neutral vowels. The only way we can capture this
with an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar is to assume
that there is some upper bound <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
such that at most <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> syllables in a
row may contain H instead of B or M.</p>
<p>Suppose no such bound exists. Then the following two strings must be
well-formed, for arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>CB(CH)<sup>k</sup>CB</li>
<li>CM(CH)<sup>k</sup>CM</li>
</ul>
<p>The following string, however, should be ill-formed because we are
mixing B and M:</p>
<ul>
<li>CB(CH)<sup>k</sup>CM</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to rule out this string, we need to forbid at least one of
the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams of <span
class="math inline">\({\rtimes}^{n-1}\)</span>CB(CH)<sup>k</sup>CM<span
class="math inline">\({\ltimes}^{n-1}\)</span>. But as long as <span
class="math inline">\(k &gt; n\)</span>, every <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram of <span
class="math inline">\({\rtimes}^{n-1}\)</span>CB(CH)<sup>k</sup>CM<span
class="math inline">\({\ltimes}^{n-1}\)</span> is also an <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram of <span
class="math inline">\({\rtimes}^{n-1}\)</span>CB(CH)<sup>k</sup>CB<span
class="math inline">\({\ltimes}^{n-1}\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\({\rtimes}^{n-1}\)</span>CM(CH)<sup>k</sup>CM<span
class="math inline">\({\ltimes}^{n-1}\)</span> (or both). Consequently,
it is impossible for an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram
grammar to rule out CB(CH)<sup>k</sup>CM without incorrectly ruling out
at least one of CB(CH)<sup>k</sup>CB and CM(CH)<sup>k</sup>CM.</p>
</div>
<p>The only way to handle all these phenomena with <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars is to stipulate the
existence of a fixed upper bound. That is because <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars can only handle locally
bounded dependencies, and stipulating an upper bound like a maximum
length for words ensures that everything is a locally bounded
dependency. While doing so does get the job done, it results in giant,
hideous grammars that do not capture the essence of the phenomenon and
that have to be adapted and changed as the assumed upper bound changes.
For all intents and purposes, this is a horrible way of handling these
phenomena.</p>
<h2 id="phonological-tiers-allow-for-smaller-grammars">Phonological
tiers allow for smaller grammars</h2>
<p>If you have some background in phonology, you might already be
thinking that there is a very simple solution to all this: for any given
string, we project a <strong>tier</strong> that contains only the
segments that we care about and use an <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar to regulate the shape of
that tier.</p>
<div class="example">
<p>For sibilant harmony, we want a sibilant tier that contains all
sibilants (<em>s</em> and <em>ʃ</em>). And this sibilant tier must be
well-formed according to a negative bigram grammar that forbids
<em>sʃ</em> and <em>ʃs</em>. That’s one darn small grammar.</p>
<p>The sibilant tier of <em>hasxintilawas</em> is <em>ss</em>, which is
allowed by the negative grammar. The illicit <em>hasxintilawaʃ</em>, on
the other hand, has the sibilant tier <em>sʃ</em>, which is not
allowed.</p>
<p><img src="tier_good.svg" alt="tier_good.svg" /></p>
<p><img src="tier_bad.svg" alt="tier_bad.svg" /></p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Carry out the same calculations for</p>
<ul>
<li><em>haʃxintilawaʃ</em>,</li>
<li><em>haʃxinitilawas</em>, and</li>
<li><em>ʃtajanowonowaʃ</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is to say, write down their tiers (or draw them), and then
indicate whether the tier is well-formed or ill-formed according to the
negative bigram grammar above.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>As an abstract example, suppose that our alphabet consists of <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, and that all symbols except <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> should be projected on the tier. What
is the tier of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathit{aabaccacb}\)</span>?</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<p>Tiers also provide a solution for Korean vowel harmony. Let us once
again consider only words that do not contain any instances of the
neutral vowel H. We construct a vowel harmony tier that contains every
instance of B and M, but no consonants at all. For example, a word of
the form CGBCBCM would have the vowel harmony tier BBM. On the vowel
harmony tier, there must be no occurrences of BM or MB, which can easily
be enforced by a negative bigram grammar.</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the strings below, construct its vowel harmony tier
and say whether the tier is well-formed according to the negative bigram
grammar above.</p>
<ul>
<li>CBCGBCB</li>
<li>CGMCBCM</li>
<li>CB</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Now let us also consider words with the neutral vowel class H, for
instance the illicit CBCHCHCM. Do we need to make any modifications to
the vowel harmony tier or the negative bigram grammar? If so, what are
those modifications?</p>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>For each one of the following, say whether it is true or false.
Justify your answer.</p>
<ul>
<li>The size of the negative bigram grammar regulating the vowel harmony
tier is not contingent on the syllable structure of Korean.</li>
<li>The size of the negative bigram grammar regulating the vowel harmony
tier is not contingent on the number of consonants in Korean.</li>
<li>The size of the negative bigram grammar regulating the vowel harmony
tier is not contingent on the number of vowels in Korean.</li>
<li>The size of the negative bigram grammar regulating the vowel harmony
tier is not contingent on any fixed upper bound on the length of
words.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As you can see from those examples (and exercises), tiers are a
wonderful addition to our toolbox. They endow <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars with the ability to
handle long-distance phenomena without unappealing assumptions such as
an upper bound on the length of words. Instead of applying directly to
the string, the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar
instead regulates the shape of a tier. Since the tier does not contain
symbols that can never matter for the dependency, the grammar can state
the relevant generalizations more succinctly without mentioning
irrelevant material. And as we will see in the next unit, tiers are a
very minimal addition that preserve many of the properties we have
previously established for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram
grammars.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<ul>
<li>No <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammar provides an
elegant account of long-distance phenomena.</li>
<li>The larger the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-grams, the
larger the grammar; large grammars are unwieldy and inefficient.</li>
<li>Phonological <strong>tiers</strong> allow for more compact grammars

<li>Unless one assumes an upper bound on the length of long-distance
dependencies, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gram grammars
